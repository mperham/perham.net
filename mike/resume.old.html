<h2>Summary</h2>

I am a software developer, technical speaker and open source enthusiast.  For 8 years I
focused on the design and development of object-oriented ecommerce and
enterprise systems in Java.  The last 5 years focused on building 
systems with open source tools, Ruby and Ruby on Rails.  I'm currently based in San Francisco

<p>My long-term focus at IBM (which acquired Webify in 8/06) is the design and implementation of service-oriented applications based on IBM's Business Services Fabric middleware.  Since these applications are different from traditional monolithic applications, there is a real need to design and document how to build these applications.

<h3>Lead Architect - marketGRAVITY web-based merchandising system</h3>
<p>
I was lead architect and the main developer of this system.  During this time, I:
<p>
<ul>
<li>designed the overall architecture of the system
<li>designed and implemented the majority of the core merchandising object model
<li>designed and implemented the majority of the JSP/tag/applet-based UI
<li>designed and implemented many of the business engines including <a
href="mg/workflow.gif">workflow</a>, <a href="mg/pricing.gif">pricing</a>
and security
<li>tuned and optimized the system to meet performance goals
</ul>
The core system runs on BEA Weblogic 6.0 with Oracle 8i for the RDBMS and
Struts for the MVC UI framework.  You can read a marketing description of
the marketGRAVITY system <a href="mg/">here</a>.  The system was also
purchased by <a href="http://www.romecorp.com">Rome</a> to get them a working 
source base to build their applications on.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Senior Web Developer - living.com (4/99 - 7/00)</h3>
<p>
I was lead developer in charge of design and implementation of several
large subsystems of the living.com website including application server
architecture (fault tolerance, session failover, load balancing, security)
and overall website performance.  I also designed and wrote several large
components of the site including user authentication and profiles,
shopping cart and the customer service representative backend.  At its
peak, the living.com site handled an average of 3000 simultaneous users
with capacity for 15000.  It ran on ATG Dynamo with Oracle 8i.

<p>
<h3>Software Developer - Trilogy Software (1/98 - 4/99)</h3>
<p>
I was a member of the team responsible for integration between Trilogy's
applications and 3rd party ERP systems.  To this end, I designed and wrote
a data transformation and transfer engine for synchronization between 2
dissimilar databases.  This involved a large amount of JDBC work with
several different types of databases including MS Access, Oracle, and DB2.
