<P><B>A Brief History</B></P>

<P>It all started in 1933 when a group of nine amibitious and enterprising
young men from Cornell University organized a cooperative organization
called Llenroc (spelled C-o-r-n-e-l-l backwards) Lodge Association. The
idea itself was not new as cooperative housing was initiated earlier at
Yale, but Llenroc was the first cooperative at Cornell University. The
students secured a lease from the then owner Dr. Edward Amherst Ott who
headed the Association for a brief period. The house was finally signed
over to the students in 1938.</P>

<P>Built in the early 1850's, the house initially housed a horse stable
and servant's quarters for Ezra Cornell. When converted for use as a cooperative
in 1937, the house was divided into north and south dormers where the members
slept. Then there were some study rooms where they studied four in a room!
In 1940, the name of the house was changed to Cayuga Lodge Student Resident
Association, Inc. In 1991 the house underwent another major change when
it became coeducational and the dormers were converted into individual
rooms. Today there are approximately 23 students living here who are either
in single or double rooms.</P>

<P>In the early days, candidates for house membership had to go through
a lengthy application process and the house members voted on the recommendations
of the membership committee. Then they had to pass a 100-question exam
on the history and operations of the house before they were finally inducted
into the house membership. At that time there used to be an average of
40 members living in the house. Each member was supposed to perform 20
hours plus work on a special project each semester. A dining room served
the house members and at one point the dining services were opened to the
public. Since then the induction process has been relaxed somewhat and
due to the conversion of dormers into individual rooms about 25 students
can be accomodated at present. The weekly contribution has been reduced
to one of a number of jobs that are rotated through the semester plus 10
hours of work on a special project. The dining services have been replaced
by individual cooking or informal cooking groups that anyone can organize.</P>
