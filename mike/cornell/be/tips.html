<H2>BeOS Driver Tips and Tricks</H2>
This is meant to be a repository for all the knowledge people have
learned the hard way while writing BeOS drivers.  This is not 
light reading material.  All material has been edited to keep
the fluff to a minimum (.sigs, etc...)

>flag set, and then doing something to clear the interrupt on the
>actual device hardware.  Since calling release_sem does in fact cause
>a reschedule, the interrupt handler will continue running 'later', possibly
>even on another processor (on beboxes and MP macs).  If the device in the
>meantime has another interrupt ready, and the interrupt handler then clears
>the interrupt, you lose an interrupt!

>If the clearing happens at just the right time, i.e after the device has
>generated the interrupt causing the cpu taking i.o interrupts to be
>interrupted, but before that cpu can read the interrupt source register,
>you get the wonderful 'ALIENS...' message.
