<P>Tcl-DP is a loadable module for Tcl that adds advanced communication features 
to Tcl/Tk. Tcl-DP supports communication by serial links, IP-multicast, TCP, 
UDP, and email, contains a remote procedure call (RPC) mechanism, and supports 
the design of new protocols using modules called <I>filters</I>. Tcl-DP 1.0 
[Smi93] was released four years ago and has since been used for numerous 
commercial and academic projects. With age, however, the code became so brittle 
that adding new features and porting to new versions of Tcl was nearly 
impossible. Furthermore, many of Tcl-DP&#8217;s original features were incorporated in 
the Tcl core, making them redundant in Tcl-DP. Hence, we decided to write the 
latest version of Tcl-DP (version 4.0) from scratch. In this paper, we describe 
the new features of Tcl-DP 4.0, its architecture and implementation, and 
problems we encountered with Tcl&#8217;s new I/O system.</P>
<P><FONT size=5><B>The Tcl-DP API</B></FONT></P>
<P>The Tcl-DP API contains two main parts: commands for general communication 
and command for remote procedure call (RPC). Figure 1 demonstrates Tcl-DP&#8217;s RPC 
mechanism by showing how to implement a network-wide server for generating 
unique identifiers. The left side of the figure shows the code that is executed 
on the server, the right side shows the code that is executed on the client.</P>
<P align=center><FONT size=3><IMG height=164 src="h2.gif" 
width=567></FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT size=3>Figure 1 -- A Simple ID server</FONT></P>
<P>The first command executed on both client and server is the Tcl <FONT 
face="Courier New">package</FONT> command, which makes Tcl-DP library functions 
and commands available in the current Tcl interpreter. The server executes the 
<FONT face="Courier New">dp_MakeRPCServer</FONT> command, which creates a socket 
that is waiting for a client to connect. Finally, the server defines the <FONT 
face="Courier New">getID</FONT> command, which generates and returns a unique 
identifier.</P>
<P>The client connects to the server using the <FONT 
face="Courier New">dp_MakeRPCClient</FONT> command, which returns a handle that 
can be used to communicate to the server. Finally, the client invokes the <FONT 
face="Courier New">getID</FONT> command on the server using the <FONT 
face="Courier New">dp_RPC</FONT> command. This causes a message containing the 
command to be evaluated to be sent to the server, where it is evaluated and the 
results returned.</P>
<P>Tcl-DP also contains commands to support basic network communication. Figure 
2 shows how to use Tcl-DP&#8217;s communication facilities to transfer the file <FONT 
face="Courier New">/etc/motd</FONT> from a client machine to the server 
(alvin.cs.cornell.edu).</P>

width=578></FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT size=3>Figure 2 &#8211; Simple network communication</FONT></P>
<P>After loading Tcl-DP using the <FONT face="Courier New">package</FONT> 
command, the server uses Tcl-DP&#8217;s <FONT face=Courier>dp_connect</FONT> command 
to create a TCP socket that is waiting for a connection on port 1944. The server 
then issues the <FONT face="Courier New">dp_accept</FONT> command, which blocks 
until a client connects, and then returns a handle for the newly connected 
client. Once a client is connected, the server opens <FONT 
face="Courier New">/tmp/motd</FONT>, copies the data sent over the channel into 
it, and closes the file and socket.</P>
<P>The client connects to the server using <FONT 
face="Courier New">dp_connect</FONT>, giving the hostname and port number of the 
waiting server. After connecting, the client opens <FONT 
face="Courier New">/etc/motd</FONT>, copies it to the channel, and closes the 
file and socket.</P>
<P>Note that once a channel is opened, it is treated as any other file: it can 
be read from, written to, or checked for the EOF condition (which, in the case 
of TCP, this means the connection has been closed).</P>
<P><FONT size=5><B>New Features</B></FONT></P>
<P>The features described above were available in earlier versions of Tcl-DP. In 
version 4.0, we added several new features. This section describes those 
features.</P>
<P>In addition to TCP, UDP and IP multicast, DP 4.0 supports communication via 
serial ports and email. No matter what its type, a channel is opened using the 
dp_connect command and supports the same input/output operations. The mechanism 
allows one channel to be substituted for another in most programs &#8211; only the 
channel creation and configuration options (issued through the Tcl <FONT 
face="Courier New">fconfigure</FONT> command) differ. For example, by changing 
the parameters to <FONT face="Courier New">dp_connect</FONT> and deleting the 
call to <FONT face="Courier New">dp_accept</FONT> in Figure 2, we can transfer 
the file over a serial line instead of a TCP connection, as shown in Figure 
3.</P>
<P align=center><FONT size=1><IMG height=176 src="h4.gif" 
width=575></FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT size=3>Figure 3 &#8211; Communication over a serial 
connection</FONT></P>
<P>The Tcl-DP RPC mechanism has also been changed and enhanced. Recursive and 
out-of-order RPCs are now supported. This point will be covered in detail below. 
Perhaps the most important new ability is that RPCs can now be performed over 
any Tcl channel as long as it has been registered with the <FONT 
face=Courier>dp_admin</FONT> command. More precisely, once a channel is created, 
the program can call <FONT face="Courier New">dp_admin register chanID</FONT>, 
which creates a file handler so that an inbound RPC request is automatically 
processed. Calling <FONT face="Courier New">dp_admin delete chanID</FONT> 
disables this behavior. The significance of this feature is that <FONT 
face="Courier New">dp_RPC</FONT> and <FONT face="Courier New">dp_RDO</FONT> can 
be performed over any channel, although <FONT face="Courier New">dp_RPC</FONT> 
should only be performed over reliable channels since packet loss can cause a 
program to hang while waiting for a response from the server.</P>
<P>Another new feature in DP 4.0 is <I>filters</I>. Filters sit between the 
program and the channel, transparently modifying data (e.g., 
encrypting/decrypting it). DP 4.0 has two types of filters: <I>plugin 
filters</I> and <I>filter channels</I>. </P>
<P>A plugin filter is designed for the common case where the data is modified 
using a functional interface. Encryption and decryption are examples of plugin 
filters. To create a plugin filter, the programmer call dp_connect plugfilter, 
passing in three parameters: the channel to use for input/output, and two filter 
functions, one for input and one for output.</P>
<P>Figure 4 shows how to use a plugin filter. In this example, a server accepts 
a connection from a client (the first three lines of code), and then attaches an 
exclusive-or (xor) filter to that channel to weakly encrypt the data. Any data 
written to the channel is transparently filtered by exclusive-or&#8217;ing it with a 
key (the key can be changed using the <FONT face="Courier New">fconfigure</FONT> 
command on the plugin channel). To decrypt the data, the user needs another xor 
plugin filter on the receiving side.</P>
<P>DP 4.0 comes with a uuencode/decode filter, a xor excryption filter, a hex to 
binary conversion filter, and a <FONT face=Courier>tclfilter</FONT> plugin which 
allows any Tcl procedure to be used as a filter. New filters are easy to write 
(they require two procedures), and are registered using a C API.</P>
<P>The filter mechanism is general and powerful. For example, by using uuencode 
filters, binary data can be read from, or written to, channels. We have used 
filters to provide a simple command line interface to a video camera whose 
pan/zoom/tilt is controlled by a binary protocol over an RS232 interface. We 
believe it is possible to use plugin filters to provide APIs for secure 
communication, authentication, and gateways to binary RPC mechanisms.</P>
<P align=center><FONT size=3><IMG height=100 src="h5.gif" 
width=577></FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT size=3>Figure 4 &#8211; Attaching a plugin filter</FONT></P>
<P>Certain tasks are difficult or impossible to perform using plugin filters. 
For these cases, filter channels are appropriate. Filter channels are complete 
channels with configurable options and I/O routines. A filter channel is created 
using the <FONT face="Courier New">dp_connect</FONT> command, passing in the 
channel type as the first argument and a flag indicating the channel to use for 
input/output. </P>
<P>To understand why filter channels are needed, consider the following 
scenario. A user needs to transmit datagrams over a stream channel (e.g., TCP). 
Since the channel has stream semantics, the datagram boundaries will be lost in 
transmission. In other words, if the user sends two datagrams "message1" and 
"message2" over the channel, the receiver might read "mess" on the first read, 
and "age1message2" on a second read.</P>
<P>A simple way to keep the datagram boundaries is to build <I>packetizer</I>, 
which attaches a length field to each message. At the receiver, a 
<I>depacketizer</I> reads the length field and returns either a whole packet or 
nothing (in the case of a partial read). It is difficult to build a packetizer 
using plugin because they only provide functional filtering. In this case, a 
filter channel is used.</P>
<P>With filter channels, it is possible to build protocol stacks that provide, 
for example, flow control and guaranteed transmission over unreliable channels 
(any takers?).</P>
<P><FONT size=5><B>Implementation</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4><I>Channels</I></FONT></P>
<P>Since version 7.5, Tcl has performed all I/O via <I>Tcl_Channels</I>. Figure 
5 shows a block diagram of Tcl-DP&#8217;s I/O system. The Tcl_Channel abstraction 
pushes all I/O operations into a <I>channel driver</I>, so that a generic set of 
operations can be performed on any communications method. For instance, to read 
data from a channel, one calls the Tcl_Read() function, which will invoke the 
channel driver&#8217;s input method to retrieve data available on that channel. DP 4.0 
provides drivers for 5 channel types: TCP, UDP, IP multicast, serial ports and 
email. The <FONT face="Courier New">dp_RPC</FONT> and <FONT 
face="Courier New">dp_RDO</FONT> commands sit above the Tcl I/O layer, which 
allows us to use any channel for RPC communication. </P>
<P align=center><IMG height=211 src="h6.gif" width=186></P>
<P><FONT size=4><I>RPC</I></FONT></P>
<P>The implementation of RPCs changed significantly in DP 4.0. The new mechanism 
allows RPCs to be issued over any Tcl channel, and handles duplicate or out of 
order return of RPCs. In addition, the protocol contains no binary data (unlike 
previous versions), which allows a Tcl-only implementation of RPC handlers using 
Tcl&#8217;s socket command. These changes make the new protocol incompatible with 
previous versions, but we felt the new features and bug fixes justified the 
incompatibility. </P>
<P>Figure 6 shows the layout of an RPC/RDO packet. <I>Length</I> is a six digit 
decimal string that gives the size of the entire packet, including the length 
field itself. <I>Space</I> is a delimiter between fields and is simply the space 
character. <I>Type</I> is a one byte token character that denotes the type of 
this packet. For types of packets are defined: RPC (&#8216;e&#8217;), RDO (&#8216;d&#8217;), error 
(&#8216;x&#8217;), or return value (&#8216;r&#8217;). <I>ID</I> is a six digit decimal string that 
specifies an identifier for the RPC message (and its return value). It is used 
in processing out-of-order RPCs, as explained below. Finally, <I>msg</I> is the 
Tcl command to be evaluated.</P>
<P>For example, the command <FONT face="Courier New">dp_RPC tcp0 puts hi</FONT> 
generates in the packet</P>
<P>"<FONT face="Courier New"> 23 e 1 puts hi</FONT>"</P>

<P align=center><FONT size=3>Figure 6 &#8211; RPC packet format</FONT></P>
<P>When a message arrives on an RPC channel, Tcl executes a file callback to 
process the message. This callback reads the message, buffering partial reads if 
necessary. It then processes the packet as follows:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>If the packet is an RPC (as determined by the <I>type</I> field), the 
  command is evaluated. If there is an error, <I>interp-&gt;errorInfo</I> is 
  returned to the sender in <I>msg</I>. Otherwise, <I>interp-&gt;result</I> is 
  returned to the sender in <I>msg</I>. 
  <LI>If the packet is an RDO, the command is evaluated. Nothing is returned to 
  the sender. 
  <LI>If the packet is an error code or a return value, the <I>id</I> field is 
  used as an index into the <I>activation record</I> for the RPC, which is 
  described below. The RPC is marked as received, the error condition set (if 
  appropriate), and <I>msg</I> copied into the activation record. </LI></UL>
<P>Whenever an RPC is sent, an identifier (<I>id</I>) is generated and an 
activation record is created. This activation record tracks all currently 
executing RPCs, and allows for out-of-order and recursive RPCs. It is stored in 
a table, using <I>id</I> as an index. To understand the function of the 
activation record, consider the following example.</P>
<P>A Tcl-DP process sends an RPC (id=1) to host A. DP creates an activation 
record for the RPC and waits in an event loop for the return message. While 
waiting, another event (e.g., a timer event) triggers the issuance of a second 
RPC (id=2) to host B. Again, DP DP creates an activation record for the RPC and 
waits in a new event loop for the return message. If RPC #1 now returns, it can 
not be processed immediately, since the current event loop, and associated call 
stack, is for RPC #2. Thus, DP simply records the RPC return value in the 
activation record associated with RPC #1. When RPC #2 returns, it is marked as 
received, breaking the event loop and return to the original loop. This loop 
exits immediately, since the activation record indicates the RPC is 
received.</P>
<P>The surprising thing about the mechanism is that its expression in C is 
extremely elegant. The callback for processing a return value or error message 
just marks the appropriate activation record. The event loop simply processes 
one event until the associated activation record indicates the return value has 
been received.</P>
<P><FONT size=5><B>Open Issues</B></FONT></P>
<P>While designing DP 4.0, we ran into several problems, which we discuss in 
this section.</P>
<P><FONT size=4><I>Peeking and Tcl I/O</I></FONT></P>
<P>In previous versions of DP, peeking was allowed on socket reads. Peeking 
allows a <FONT face="Courier New">read</FONT> function call to return a portion 
of the input available on a channel without consuming the data. It is useful 
when processing input messages, since a message header can be read to decide 
which routine should process the message.</P>
<P>The Tcl I/O subsystem buffers all channel input. Unfortunately, this 
buffering also makes peeking on a channel impossible. Consider the following 
example: a user wishes to peek at the first 2 bytes of a 12-byte message on a 
UDP channel. Suppose the message is "123456789abc". Assume we <FONT 
face="Courier New">fconfigure</FONT> the socket for peeking, so that the <FONT 
face="Courier New">read()</FONT> system call does not consume the available data 
on the socket. When Tcl calls the channel&#8217;s input procedure to read the data on 
the socket; it reads 10 bytes, returning 2 bytes ("12") to the caller and 
buffering the rest ("3456789a"). When the program attempts to read the message 
out of the socket, Tcl will concatenate the 8 bytes of buffered data with data 
available on the socket, resulting in a 20 byte message 
("3456789a123456789abc").</P>
<P>We provide a work-around for this problem using the <FONT 
face="Courier New">dp_recv</FONT> command, which allows direct, unbuffered 
access to a channel&#8217;s input procedure.</P>
<P><FONT size=4><I>RPC over unreliable channels</I></FONT></P>
<P>The dp_RPC command blocks until a return value is received. In DP, the RPC 
procedure waits in an event loop, repeatedly calling <FONT 
face=Courier>Tcl_DoOneEvent()</FONT> until an answer for the RPC is received. 
Unfortunately, this also means that when an RPC message (or its return value) is 
lost, the dp_RPC call will never return. Since DP 4.0 allows RPC over unreliable 
(e.g., UDP) channels, such an event is possible. We see three work-arounds for 
this case. First, one can always use <FONT face="Courier New">dp_RDO</FONT> to 
remotely invoke a command. Since <FONT face="Courier New">dp_RDO</FONT> does not 
block, the program will lock up when a message is lost. A second option is to 
use the <FONT face="Courier New">&#8211;timeout</FONT> flag of <FONT 
face="Courier New">dp_RPC</FONT>. This flag creates a timer event that marks the 
RPC&#8217;s activation record as complete after a specified time, causing the event 
loop to terminate and the <FONT face="Courier New">dp_RPC</FONT> call to return 
an error. The third option is to provide a filter channel that implements 
retransmission for the unreliable channel, and then issue RPCs over that 
channel. We have not yet written such a filter channel.</P>
<H2><FONT size=5><B>Status and Conclusion</B></FONT></H2>
<P>In this paper, we described the new features and implementation of Tcl-DP 
4.0. Tcl-DP 4.0 is a dynamically loadable version of Tcl-DP which adds several 
new features including new channel types, channel filters, and better RPC 
support. Tcl-DP is freely available from
