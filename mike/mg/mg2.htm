                  <br>
                  At the core of marketGRAVITY is the Product Information Center, 
                  a content aggregation, organization and definition tool. It 
                  contains a multi-dimensional &quot;blueprint&quot; for a company's 
                  products. It encapsulates all information and business intelligence 
                  required to serve the needs of a broad range of users - from 
                  the marketers and sales people bringing products to market, 
                  to customers and business partners who make purchase and design 
                  decisions. 
                  <p>The Product Information includes:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Descriptive information such as attributes and content</li>
                    <li>Complex structures such as bundles and what products they 
                      are assembled from</li>
                    <li>Partner companies and their complementary products and 
                      services</li>
                    <li>View Management to produce multiple versions of information 
                      for the same product. For example, information important 
                      to an internal salesperson would be different than how products 
                      are presented to an online visitor</li>
                    <li>Change Management to provide a structure to control modifications 
                      and allow for rollback and versioning</li>
                    <li>Dependency Management helps users understand the interdependencies 
                      of modifications to products. For example, if a product 
                      is discontinued, marketGRAVITY understands bundles that 
                      need to be redefined and pricing rules to be modified.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <b>Product Workbench</b><br>
                  The Product Workbench is a behind-the-scenes maintenance and 
                  workflow system that streamlines the processes of updating product 
                  information. The Workbench operates in conjunction with Dependency 
                  Manager, customizable business structures, permissions and automated 
                  tasks to help manage the complexities of ongoing maintenance 
                  of large product portfolios. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Data Integration &amp; Development</b> <br>
                  marketGRAVITY's open interfaces make it easy to aggregate and 
                  import data from external data stores, documents and web pages. 
                  Its Data Management Architecture and wide range of APIs can 
                  create permanent connections to and synchronize with broadly 
                  dispersed sets of product information around an organization.<br>
