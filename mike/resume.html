  <h1>Summary</h1>
  <p>
  I am a software developer, technical speaker and open source enthusiast.
  For many years now I've been self-employed, building commercial software tools focused
  on background jobs, a popular pattern for scaling transactional processing.
  </p>
  <h2>Professional Experience</h2>

  <h3 class="title">CEO, Contributed Systems (07/2014 - Present)</h3>
  <p>
    Focused on the design and development of our Sidekiq and Faktory background job systems.
    As of 2025, I have over 2000 customers and annual sales approaching $10m/year.
    I have done this with no employees, only me.
  </p>
  <p>
    I manage and develop the <a href="https://sidekiq.org">Sidekiq</a> and <a href="https://contribsys.com/faktory">Faktory</a> open source projects along with the Sidekiq Pro, Sidekiq Enterprise, and Faktory Enterprise commercial products.

  In this role, I was responsible for the health and stability of the website infrastructure, building scalable systems with Ruby and OSS tools and led a team of developers monitoring the e-commerce platform.
  TheClymb.com was Sidekiq's first customer.
  Sample technologies: Ruby, Rails, Redis, RSpec, Sidekiq, MySQL.

  <h3 class="title">Technical Lead, Carbon Five (01/2011 - 01/2012)</h3>

  Moved to San Francisco and did independent Ruby consulting for 6 months before joining C5.
  </p>
  <p>
  Developer and project lead for customer engagements with Carbon Five, a web development services company.
  In this role, I advised clients on proper development process, building scalable systems with Ruby and OSS tools and led a team of developers building software (usually Rails web sites, e.g. <a href="http://manilla.com">http://manilla.com</a>) for clients.

  queue processing systems, automated system provisioning, content generation and caching.  Worked with technologies like Varnish, nginx, Passenger, thin, Sinatra, EventMachine, Rails, Ruby, Cassandra, Solr, RabbitMQ, postgresql, ec2 and Chef.  I pushed a lot of open source based on my work to Github. 
  Spoke at LoneStarRubyConf and Austin on Rails during this time on various technical subjects.
  </p>

  <h3 class="title">Software Engineer, FiveRuns Corporation (09/2007 - 3/2009)</h3>

  I spent 15 months building FiveRuns' Manage and Dash (unreleased) services.
  I personally focus on the lower-level portions of our service, building http-based services, data processing via message queuing and performance tuning both Ruby code and MySQL schema.
  I've contributed to many open source projects during this time and spoken at several conferences and user groups in the US and Europe including Rubyconf and Railsconf Europe.
  </p>

  <h3 class="title">Software Architect, Webify Solutions, IBM Corp (05/2003 - 09/2007)</h3>
  <p>
    My long-term focus at IBM (which acquired Webify in 8/06) is the design and implementation of service-oriented applications based on IBM's Business Services Fabric middleware.
    Since these applications are different from traditional monolithic applications, there is a real need to design and document how to build these applications.
