				<p>Support for both document-passing and RPC-invocation semantics in web services is the worst decision the WSDL developers ever made.  It makes interoperability between different systems a living hell for developers and will cripple web services from being deployed widely until the industry settles on a common, well understood  format.  </p>
<p>Currently there are three formats: rpc/encoded, rpc/literal and document/literal.  WS-I has come out and said that SOAP encoding is terrible and should not be used which is true and rules out rpc/encoded.  The problem is that pretty much ever system until now has defaulted to rpc/encoded so that is what most people use, including the public services exposed by Amazon and Google.  Axis, the leading free and open source web service server does rpc/encoded very well and everything else pretty poorly.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not enough.  Even with rpc/literal, you do not have absolute control over the generated SOAP.  Instead the SOAP framework generates small pieces of the SOAP document which can lead to interop problems.  document/literal is the only way to get absolute control of the generated document and that is what WS-I should have mandated.  This is fundamental architecture - giving people choices here just makes for problems and delays adoption.

			<p>I love the fact that one can read most of your entry metaphorically.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve a vague sense of what SOAP is, but it&#8217;s vague enough that one can tune it out and read each instance as &#8220;soap.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, am both tired and distracted.</p>
<p>p.s. Why won&#8217;t you allow vague attempts at spamblocking in the address field?
