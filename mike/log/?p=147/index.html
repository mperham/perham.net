				<p>Author unknown.  Some interesting points.  Discuss.</p>
<p><i><br />
For good and ill, the Iraqi prisoner abuse mess will remain an issue On the one hand, right thinking Americans will abhor the stupidity of the actions while on the other hand, political glee will take control and fashion this minor event into some modern day My Lai massacre.</p>
<p>I heard some Arabs are asking for an apology. I humbly offer mine here:</p>
<p>I am sorry that the last seven times we Americans took up arms and sacrificed the blood of our youth, it was in the defense of Muslims (Bosnia, Kosovo, Gulf War 1, Kuwait, etc.).</p>
<p>I am sorry that no such call for an apology upon the extremists came after 9/11. I am sorry that all of the murderers on 9/11 were Arabs.</p>
<p>I am sorry that Arabs have to live in squalor under savage dictatorships. I am sorry that their leaders squander their wealth. I am sorry that their governments breed hate for the US in their religious schools.</p>
<p>I am sorry that Yasir Arafat was kicked out of every Arab country and high jacked the Palestinian &#8220;cause&#8221;. I am sorry that no other Arab country will take in or offer more than a token amount of financial help to those same Palestinians.</p>
<p>I am sorry that the USA has to step in and be the biggest financial<br />
supporter of poverty stricken Arabs while the insanely wealthy Arabs blame the USA.</p>
<p>I am sorry that our own left wing elite and our media can&#8217;t understand any of this. I am sorry the United Nations scammed the poor people of Iraq out of the &#8220;food for oil&#8221; money so they could get rich while the common folk suffered.</p>
<p>I am sorry that some Arab governments pay the families of homicide bombers upon their death. I am sorry that those same bombers are seeking 72 virgins? I can&#8217;t seem to find one here on Earth.</p>
<p>I am sorry that the homicide bombers think babies are a legitimate target.</p>
<p>I am sorry that our troops died to free more Arabs. I am sorry they stopped the gang rape rooms and the filling of mass graves of dissidents.</p>
<p>I am sorry they show so much restraint when their brothers in arms are killed. I am sorry that Muslim extremists have killed more Arabs than any other group.</p>
<p>I am sorry that foreign trained terrorists are trying to seize control of Iraq and return it to a terrorist state. I am sorry we don&#8217;t drop a few dozen Daisy cutters on Fallujah.</p>
<p>I am sorry every time terrorists hide they find a convenient &#8220;Holy Site&#8221;. I am sorry they didn&#8217;t apologize for driving a jet into the World Trade Center that collapsed and severely damaged Saint Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church - one of our Holy Sites.</p>
<p>I am sorry they didn&#8217;t apologize for flight 93 and 175, the USS Cole, the embassy bombings, etc.</p>
<p>I am sorry Michael Moore is American; he could feed a medium sized village in africa.</p>
<p>I am sorry the French are french?</p>
<p>America will get past this latest absurdity. We will punish those<br />
responsible because that is what we do. We hang out our dirty laundry for all the world to see. We move on. That&#8217;s one of the reasons we are hated so much. We don&#8217;t hide this stuff like all those Arab countries that are now demanding an apology.</p>
<p>Deep down inside, when most Americans saw this reported in the news, we were like - so what? We lost hundreds and made fun of a few prisoners. Sure, it was wrong, sure, it dramatically hurts our cause, but until captured we were trying to kill these same prisoners. Now we&#8217;re supposed to wring our hands because a few were humiliated? Our compassion is tempered with the vivid memories of our own people killed, mutilated and burnt amongst a joyous crowd of celebrating Fallujans.</p>
<p>If you want an apology from this American, you&#8217;re going to have a long wait. You have a better chance of finding those 72 virgins.</p>
