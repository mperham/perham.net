				<p>So myself and a bunch of my friends went to the <a href="http://www.redbullflugtag.com/">Red Bull Flugtag</a> yesterday.  The basic premise behind this event is people making large random objects that they accelerate off a ramp in the hopes that it will fly a good distance before crashing into a body of water.  &#8220;Good&#8221; in this instance is used extremely loosely as the objects are often times more silly than aerodynamic, which is usually the point.</p>
<p>Highlights of this Flugtag included the following flying objects: an alien sombero, a flying V guitar, a bowl of chips and salsa, a giant &#8220;Bevo&#8221; (the UT mascot), Snoopy&#8217;s doghouse, Mary Poppins&#8217; umbrella, etc.</p>
<p>We had a great time - it was just hilarious to watch these people fling themselves off a 30 foot tower and oftentimes plummet straight down into Town Lake.  Next time we&#8217;ll remember to bring chairs and an umbrella for the sun.  They estimated the crowd at 40,000.  I believe it - it was packed.</p>
<p>First picture is Becky with the intrepid pilot of the Flying V.  Rock on, man.  Unforunately he broke his shoulder when he crashed into one of the pickups while falling into the water.  Second picture is the chips and salsa as it falls off the ramp into the water.</p>
