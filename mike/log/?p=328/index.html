				<p>The closest place I have ever been to India before is Zimbabwe.  It&#8217;s a bit unreal to be honest.  The traffic is everything they say: there&#8217;s no lanes, potholes are more like small wells, there&#8217;s traffic 6 inches away on both sides and I don&#8217;t believe we got above 25 mph during the drive.</p>
<p>The hotel is ok but I am a little disappointed for a &#8220;5-star&#8221; hotel.  The public areas and food are fantastic but the room is mediocre.  The bed is just a fitted sheet and duvet.  The AC seems to add, not remove, humidity.  The internet access is pretty slow and costs $100/week.  The TV is your standard, crappy 20&#8243;.</p>
<p>I gave a presentation on Hibernate yesterday seemed to help some people.  It was entitled &#8220;Advanced Hibernate&#8221; and half of the room had not used Hibernate before.  Sigh.  Rule one of giving a presentation: make sure you know your audience and craft it for them.  I didn&#8217;t realize we had hired so many new developers in the last 2-3 months.</p>
<p>I also interviewed a fellow who was a &#8220;Senior Developer&#8221; at Oracle India and was asking for a pretty good salary.  Asked him to define recursion.  No idea.  Asked him what his favorite data structure is.  No idea.  Ding, have a nice day.</p>
<p>More of the same expected today.
