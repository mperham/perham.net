			<div class="entrytext">
				<p>I spent some time playing with <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org">Groovy</a> today.  It&#8217;s somewhat similar to Ruby in that it is an interpreted language like Ruby but with tight Java integration (in fact Groovy natively executes within the Java VM by generating bytecode at runtime).  Comparing its feature list, Groovy looks like a 100% rip off of Ruby (well, imitation is the &#8230;) but not implemented as professionally.  Its founder, James Strachan, is well known in the Java community as quite gifted for starting visionary open source projects (e.g. ActiveMQ, Groovy, ServiceMix, et al) but not exactly polishing them to a gleam.</p>
<p>Now along comes something like <a href="http://jruby.sf.net">JRuby</a>.  Ruby implemented on top of the Java VM, rather than a native interpreter.  It still has yet to gain any sort of momentum but it has the draw of Ruby and Rails: a powerful language combined with an incredible webapp framework.</p>
<p>My guess is people who use Java will stick with Groovy, warts and all.  It&#8217;s on the JCP fast track to become THE java scripting language so even though it may look like a pig with lipstick right now, it&#8217;ll eventually become something respectable and dependable in a production environment.</p>
<p>Those who aren&#8217;t constrained to a particular environment can evaluate Ruby.  Quite frankly Ruby is just as universal as Java, given that it can run on Linux, Windows and Mac OSX.  It&#8217;s not as polished, what with pathetic tool and IDE support, but it does have a certain clean slate appeal to it that Java, with its 100MB IDEs and monstrous enterprise application servers, cannot match.  Unfortunately Ruby does not have the mature and vast array of frameworks out there to do everything like Java.  Want to do text searching?  Out of luck in Ruby, use <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene">Lucene</a> in Java.  Want a nice web UI framework?  Ruby templates SUCK (they look identical to JSP 1.0, and that SUCKED too), Java has <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tapestry">Tapestry</a>.  In a perfect world, changing platforms wouldn&#8217;t involve two steps forward, one step back.  Alas.

			<p>We&#8217;re evaluating both Ruby (on Rails) and Groovy (rail-less). Given what RoR can do, it&#8217;s tempting to jump to Ruby.  But there&#8217;s grails (Groovy on &#8220;Rails&#8221;) which is just vaporware as of Sept 05.  And there&#8217;s trails (Java on &#8220;Rails&#8221; using Hibernate, Tapestry and Spring) which requires a bit more manual work than RoR.  Each of these projects has some deficiency or something unappealing, hence for the neophyte, it&#8217;s hard to know which to spend time learning.  I don&#8217;t want to let my Java bias blind me to the advantages of Ruby, nor do I want to learn Ruby and pine for the many Java libraries it cannot access (you mention Lucene, but what about access to all the various databases that have JDBC drivers and Ruby has only a few, etc).
