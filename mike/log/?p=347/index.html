				<p>I stopped by Frys this morning for my quarterly pilgrimage to Electronics Mecca.  I wanted to possibly buy a Game Boy Micro, maybe a clipart package (I need some good looking icons and graphics for my top secret project and I&#8217;m having a hard time finding free stuff on the web) and check out the ipod nano and anything else that struck my fancy.  Some notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The G5 PowerMacs are much faster than my Mac mini.  Anyone want to donate $2500 to my PowerMac fund?</li>
<li>The ipod nano is tiny.  Seriously tiny.  Too tiny IMO.  It&#8217;s almost like a Shuffle with a screen.  The scroll wheel felt a little flimsy and was too small to use comfortably with my admittedly large hands.</li>
<li>The Gameboy Micro is not available until later this week.  Dum kopf.</li>
<li>Every clipart package requires Windows.  Not surprising but disappointing.</li>
<li>Frys has gotten much better about showing off their TVs.  They had all of the high-end displays playing HDNet, specifically they were playing a news clip with scenes from New Orleans and the destruction really hit home because of the HD quality.  Now I want a flat panel display with HDNet.</li>
<li>JVC is the first camcorder vendor to actually &#8220;get it&#8221; and come out with a camcorder that records MPEG-2 directly to an internal hard drive.  Video can be edited on the PC/Mac and burned directly to a DVD without loss of quality.  Kudos.  Now I just need to wait for the second-gen product for the kinks to be ironed out and the price to come down a few hundred bucks.  Actually I want one that does HD and will record to HD-DVD.</li>
</ul>
