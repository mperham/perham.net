		<title>SXSW Listenings</title>
		<description>Tammy and I went to Waterloo Park near downtown to a free SXSW festival yesterday.  They had three stages running with bands switching every 30 minutes so there was a constant stream of new music.  We brought some folding chairs, plopped down under a tree and listened to ...</description>

		<title>Weekend Notes</title>
		<description>Recently I sent an email to KUT telling them how much I loved KUT3's jazz format and they asked if they could quote me in their annual report.  Now they want to get a professional photo in my house with my HD radio and any jazz memorabilia I might ...</description>

		<title>Hercules and Love Affair</title>
		<description>It may be one of the best albums of the year according to the reviewer but it sounds like boring disco electronica to me.  You've been warned.

		<title>Dungeons and Dragons</title>
		<description>I can't think of a man who had a bigger effect on gaming in the last 30 years than Gary Gygax.  Almost every game built today has some aspect of D&D in it, whether it's the unabashed fantasy story arc of dragons, orcs and elves or the statistics and ...</description>

		<title>Google Ads and the Caucus Mtns</title>
		<description>

This doesn't seem like a smart serving of ads.  The email had the word "caucus" in it so I think the ads triggered off that.  I can see the relation of the Caucus Mountains to Russia and Cyrillic but I'm not sure of the relation to Urdu, which ...</description>

		<title>Barack Obama the Antichrist</title>
		<description>Some people say Obama is like Jesus.  Others apparently believe he is closer to the Antichrist.  Personally I think he's bigger than the Beatles and thus, transitively, bigger than Jesus.

Obama > Beatles > Jesus

		<title>The Obama Show</title>
		<description>Tammy and I went downtown last night to wait and watch Barack Obama speak in front of the Capital.  The night was pleasant, the crowd was large and in good spirits and the speech was good.  Here's to our next President!

We didn't RSVP for the secure area so ...</description>

		<title>The Seattle Times: Earmarks</title>
		<description>Find out what pork your Congress(wo)men have been cooking at your expense.  Looks like Sen. Lamar Smith is the king of the Texas politicians I checked.

		<title>Toyota in F1</title>
		<description>What's hilarious about Toyota's F1 program is the absolutely abysmal rate of return on their investment.  By many accounts, they spend an obscene amount of money on the program and yet they are consistently terrible.  A point for 8th place is a good race result and 5th or ...</description>
