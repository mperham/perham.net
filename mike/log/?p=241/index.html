			<div class="entrytext">
				<p>I have bought 5-6 new albums over the last few months and figured I would say a few things about them, a la my book reviews.</p>
<p><b>Belle and Sebastian</b></p>
<p>I initially bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00000JHAU/qid=1110940122/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl15/103-9089812-2786256?v=glance&#038;s=music&#038;n=507846"><i>If You&#8217;re Feeling Sinister</i></a> based on its connections to bands I already know and love (e.g. Postal Service, Death Cab for Cutie).  On first listen I thought the album was weird but nothing special.  Since then I have found that every listen makes me love the album more and more.  It&#8217;s full of poppy bizarre lyrics that are impossible not to sing along with.</p>
<p>I recently purchased <i>Boy with the Arab Strap</i> based on my growing attachment to Sinister.  I&#8217;ve listened to it a few times in the last 48 hours and must admit that I don&#8217;t find it as good as Sinister so far.  There are a few gems (namely &#8220;Sleep the Clock Around&#8221; which could easily be mistaken for a Postal Service song) but the album as a whole does not seem to work as well.  The songs are more eclectic and it feels like the result is simply spread too thin.  We&#8217;ll see how it ages over time - I have a feeling it will grow on me.</p>
<p><b>The Shins</b></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00005JSHW/ref=pd_sim_music_1/103-9089812-2786256?v=glance&#038;s=music&#038;n=507846"><i>Oh, Inverted World</i></a> was my first foray into The Shins&#8217;s music.   I&#8217;d never heard the band before and this album made me an instant fan.  Quite simply there isn&#8217;t a bad song here - every track has some feature or hook that charms you.  It has joined Sinister in heavy rotation on the my ipod.</p>
<p><i>Chutes Too Narrow</i> was purchased due to my enchantment with Oh, Inverted World.  I need to listen to it more before I can give it a fair writeup.

			<p>Belle &#038; Sebastian are great.  Nice to see you finally get some taste.  Just don&#8217;t turn into a whiny emo kid.
