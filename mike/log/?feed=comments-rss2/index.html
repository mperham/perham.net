					<description>Ok but does he who himself is in three feet of political mud have the right to rail indignantly against another who is in four feet. It's still just politics as usual, no matte what side of the aisle your on.</description>

					<description>To me, commuting a donor isn't great but politics as usual.  Bush's actions directly impede the investigation into criminal activities by his own administration.  That's a pretty good definition of corruption and far, far worse in my opinion.</description>

					<description>Those with short memories or Democrats in general (sometimes they are one in the same) should remember that the esteemed Mr. Clinton pardoned 141 people on his last day in office... including various cronies and a convicted drug dealer whose ex wife just happened to have made a million dollar contribution to the Clinton Library construction fund. But, of course, the pardon "had nothing to do with the contribution". Let the party who is without sin cast the first indignation.</description>

					<description>And by the way, your directions were incomplete. After the "select the bookmark" part, you need to say, "then select 'properties'" to bring up the "keywords" field.</description>

					<description>Lord Zex might want to rethink this. Isn't it even easier to just have the link to your mail as a bookmark in the bookmark bar near the top of the page? No Ctrl-L, no typing... just one simple click. Or am I not understanding something?</description>

					<description>Symfony now has an extensive testing framework:
http://www.symfony-project.com/book/trunk/15-Unit-and-Functional-Testing
Also, I recently wrote a plug-in for symfony that implements model validation:
http://trac.symfony-project.com/trac/wiki/sfPropelValidateBehaviorPlugin
I realize this is an old post, but it came up on a Google search, so I thought I'd add an update. Keep up the good work!</description>

					<description>Hello Mike,
thanks a lot for this article which helped me especially on the localization subject. For others who may fiddle like I did with their .po files of gettext until they figured out the missing line, I'd like to  send a snippet of application.rb's tail:

class Object

  include GetText
  bindtextdomain("domain") # THIS ONE!
  
  def as_(*args)
    _(*args)
  end
end

Cheers [ofi]</description>
