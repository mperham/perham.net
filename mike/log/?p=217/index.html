				<p>My NSLU2 (aka SLUG) is a great little device that provides a file server to my home network without making noise/heat, taking a lot of space, drawing a lot of power, etc.  One of the few issues I have with it is that it does not power down the disk.  Given that I only use it maybe 5 minutes a day, there&#8217;s very little reason why the disk should be spinning the other 23:55.  The NSLU2 runs Linux and the way to spin down disks in Linux is through a command called &#8216;hdparm&#8217;.  Since the SLUG does not come with hdparm installed, I figured I would need to install the <a href="http://www.nslu2-linux.org/wiki/Unslung/HomePage">Unslung</a> replacement firmware and then install one of its packages with hdparm in it.</p>
<p>When I initially tried to upgrade the firmware, I did it over wireless and with a HTTP proxy server.  Both of these are no-nos when trying to achieve a perfectly reliable HTTP upload with the predictable result: I &#8216;bricked&#8217; my SLUG.  Thankfully there is a recovery mode built into the NSLU2 and by following a <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/nslu2-linux/message/1096">set of very arcane instructions</a> I managed to recover from the bungled upgrade.  I fixed both network issues and this time the upgrade proceeded smoothly with the end result being that my SLUG is now running Unslung 3.16.</p>
<p>I installed busybox 1.00 and openssh 3.8.  Busybox does have hdparm built into it <b>BUT</b> the SLUG mounts the USB drive as a SCSI device and hdparm does not handle power saving with SCSI drives!  Argh.  This means I will have to pack up my disk and bring it into work so I can plug it into one of the servers there and issue the proper hdparm command via it.  At least I have ssh running on the SLUG and so therefore have scp access to the SLUG but what a price to pay for it&#8230;

			<p>On one of the best football days/evenings of the year, you were messin&#8217; with computers. And even Becky couldn&#8217;t get you to watch the &#8220;horns&#8221; win the Rose Bowl on the last play of the game??? You really are a geek. <img src='http://www.perham.net/mike/log/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />
