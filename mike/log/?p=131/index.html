				<p>My Latitude D600 has been half broken for the last month or so and both hinges on the LCD panel finally broke this weekend with the result being that the LCD panel flapped uselessly.  So I called up Dell Monday and asked about repairs.  Now I had had keyboard issues with my last Dell so I bought the extended 3-yr warranty with this one.  This was key - the guy said &#8220;Oh you have the rapid response warranty&#8221; and hooked me up with AirEx to pick up the laptop at my house with a prefit and prelabeled box so I had to do nothing.  Excellent.  Their turn around time is 3-5 biz days so we&#8217;ll see how long it will take to get the machine back to me and the quality of the fix so enough.</p>
<p>Since my laptop is out of commission I decided to work from home for the next few days but the noise of my desktop was driving me mad so I bought a new case/mboard to build a nice, quiet system.  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=56-101-428&#038;depa=1">Here&#8217;s what I bought</a>.  It&#8217;s basically the size of a toaster and comes built in with pretty much everything you need - you provide CPU, RAM, HD and CD/DVD.  I bought a Mobile Athlon so it&#8217;ll run cooler than normal and 512MB of RAM.  Should give me a nice speedup over my current machine while also being much quieter and something I can eventually move into the living room as an HTPC if I feel like it.
