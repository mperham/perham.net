				<p>Well, this track day was a little more exciting than the usual track day.  I reserved a U-Haul motorcycle trailer Saturday morning for pickup the next day.  When I got there, the fellow checked the lights only to find that the right blinker did not work.  30 minutes of rewiring proved fruitless and I left with nothing but consolation from the gentleman.</p>
<p>So Plan B - Mom and Dad would drive down to College Station with me riding along in caravan Sunday night.  I would stay at their hotel room that night, ride in the track day, stay the next night and ride home at the crack of dawn Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>My goal for this track day was to get down to a 2:15 lap time.  I was turning 2:25 last time I was there 4-5 track days ago so I figured a 10 second drop would not be out of the question.  My first session saw a 2:22 and I knew the times would drop over the course of the day.  Group C (my group, the slow group) proved to be slow but sparse enough where traffic was rarely an issue.  I passed almost everyone at will and was only passed once by a psycho on a red SV who almost lost the rear end as he passed me on the inside.  I followed him with no small amount of rage just to prove I was as fast as him and wound up turning my fastest lap of the day: 2:16.  He got away from me in traffic but I stayed with him for the half lap before.</p>
<p>There was a dude on a Harley V-Rod cruising around - that was pretty cool.  He was very slow (I passed him twice per session usually) but I was glad he was out there if only for the entertainment value!</p>
<p>I managed to find a ride home that night with Robin, a friend from my <a href="http://www.cycleforums.com">motorcycle board</a>.  She was taking another guy from the board, Byron.  Unfortunately Byron drew the short straw, crashed in the afternoon and got a sweet ride to the hospital for his trouble.  We packed up one session early in order to pick him up from the hospital.  He was unharmed except for a concussion which played havok with his short term memory.  Is there anything funnier/more tiring than a person asking you the same question every 5 minutes?</p>
<p>He&#8217;s talking about selling his bike and picking up a metric cruiser instead.  I think that&#8217;s an overreaction - hopefully he will let a few weeks pass to get some perspective and avoid a rash decision.</p>
<p>Anywho, I think I&#8217;ll be upgrading to Group B next trackday.  All my friends in Group B seem to think I&#8217;ll be plenty fast to hang with the midpack.  It&#8217;s about time!</p>
