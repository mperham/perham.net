They had three stages running with bands switching every 30 minutes so there was a constant stream of new music.  We brought some folding chairs, plopped down under a tree and listened to five bands over the course of two hours.  First up was <a href="http://www.myspace.com/aloha">Aloha</a>, a great band from NYC.  They reminded me a bit of one of my favorite bands, American Analog Set, and that&#8217;s a good thing.  Next up was <a href="http://www.shearwatermusic.com/">Shearwater</a>, a local Austin band with a nice variety of instruments.  I really liked both of these bands as they didn&#8217;t just stick with the standard rock formula but often ventured into different genres and used different instruments.  Analog synths, vibes, standup bass, banjo - all provided a nice mix of textures to work with in their music.  The next three bands were forgettable with a more generic rock sound that apparently traded volume for any sense of subtlety or dynamics.</p>
<p>We also happened to run into my friends and ex-co-workers Nik, Patrick and Aaron who were also there enjoying the music.  I had a delicious snow cone.  In summary, it was the best summer ever.  <img src='http://www.perham.net/mike/log/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

Now they want to get a professional photo in my house with my HD radio and any jazz memorabilia I might have.  I think it&#8217;ll probably be a shot with me playing my bass.  Pretty cool!</p>
<p>I hacked my SLUG device yesterday to <a href="http://www.nslu2-linux.org/wiki/HowTo/OverClockTheSlug">double its speed</a>.  It runs Linux and was previously getting 133 BogoMIPS.  Now it&#8217;s at 266 BogoMIPS.  My 2.2Ghz Core 2 MacBook Pro, by comparison, gets 4400 BogoMIPS.  Not the speediest device but what do you expect from a 4 year old device which draws < 5 watts?</p>

The night was pleasant, the crowd was large and in good spirits and the speech was good.  Here&#8217;s to our next President!</p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t RSVP for the secure area so we were about a block away from the podium.  This is the best my camera could do at 16x zoom.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what the actual scene looked like an hour before.  It got significantly more crowded such that the entire block was packed like sardines with people.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.perham.net/mike/log/?p=730"><![CDATA[<p>What&#8217;s hilarious about Toyota&#8217;s F1 program is the absolutely abysmal rate of return on their investment.  By many accounts, they spend an obscene amount of money on the program and yet they are consistently <em>terrible</em>.  A point for 8th place is a good race result and 5th or 6th place is stellar.</p>
<p>And the sad thing is they continue to do this year after year.  I&#8217;ve been following F1 for about 5-6 years now and it&#8217;s always been the same story.  At what point do they pack their bags and head home?  Or do they double down and buy a better team?</p>
