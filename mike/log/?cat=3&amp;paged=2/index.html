					<p>I got back from Jamaica last night.  The Perham family spent 5 days at Riu Ocho Rios on the northwest part of Jamaica.  There&#8217;s not much story to it, we just sunned ourselves 4 days and went into town the 5th to shop.  One interesting fact is that <strong>every</strong> gift shop we went into was owned by an Indian.  Who would have expected a small Indian community in the middle of the Caribbean?

					<p>One of the things that makes me most angry about the Bush Administration&#8217;s actions over the last few years is their continual insistence that America is at war and will continue to be until we defeat the terrorists.  Until then they need to be able to <a href="http://www.schneier.com/essay-100.html">spy on Americans</a> without oversight, compile <a href="http://www.schneier.com/essay-096.html">&#8220;no-fly&#8221; lists</a> of &#8220;terrorist&#8221; names with <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2002/09/27/MN181034.DTL&#038;type=printable">no accountability</a> and send agents to <a href="http://www.southcoasttoday.com/daily/12-05/12-17-05/a09lo650.htm">visit students</a> doing book reports.</p>
<p>What a load of crap.  Did you know that Egypt&#8217;s &#8220;president&#8221; has led the country for the last 25 years in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency#Egypt">&#8220;state of emergency&#8221;</a>?</p>
<p>Wars are fought against other governments.  America is not at war.  Average people, no matter how well equipped, who kill other people are criminals.  Nations who harbor those people are corrupt states.  When civil liberties are restricted, it is expected that this is due to an ongoing and urgent need.  Being on a war footing or in a state of emergency for years or even decades against a criminal element thousands of miles away makes no sense and disgraces the original intent of this country as a nation based on freedom for all.

					<p>Well, it&#8217;s really cold here in Austin.  The thermometer says 26 F and drizzling which means ice tomorrow morning.  That means Mike gets to work from home tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be heading out the <a href="http://opaldivines.com/">Whiskey Festival</a> tomorrow night to warm up.  I went last year and sampled about 10 whiskeys before cutting myself off since I drove myself.  This year I have 5 co-workers going with me, one of them volunteered to act as designated driver so I can sample a greater percentage of the field.

				<div class="entry">
					<p>My disenchantment with my job grows daily.  The more I use Rails, the more I dislike the absolute mountain of crap that is J2EE.  Certainly I want to do the best I can for Webify but there is no joy in working with J2EE anymore.</p>
<p>So I face quite the quandary: J2EE pays very well.  I have been working with Java for 8 years now, have lots of experience and I am essentially at the top of the pecking order of engineers at my current job.  To leave the J2EE world would seem to be career suicide.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I started out writing C in Unix and when Java came out, I saw what an amazing productivity increase it gave to developers.  So I jumped onto it as quickly as possible and never looked back - it allowed me to focus on writing applications and not have to worry about misc crap like memory management.  Remember how Java initially started out as a language for applets and OS-independent GUI applications but really picked up steam when people realized how powerful it was for building web applications?  I see the same trend with Ruby and Rails.  Ruby is 10 years old but really didn&#8217;t get much momentum until Rails came along.  The two combined give such a productivity increase to the average web developer that I can&#8217;t help but think that Rails is the wedge that will eventually drive more and more developers away from their current stacks of choice because it is simply head and shoulders more productive than anything else.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, Java has seen an incredible adoption rate but with that success has come bureaucracy, enterprise baggage and a larger and larger set of requirements just to get a simple dynamic web application working.  A reasonable java web application requires maven, hibernate, spring, tapestry, tomcat, cactus, junit, eclipse, the 20-30 dependencies that they bring in recursively and mountains of XML configuration to tie them all together.  And that doesn&#8217;t even cover message queuing, asynchronous scheduling and other, more complex areas of J2EE.</p>
<p>Rails has the simple stuff all integrated into one seamless package.  It doesn&#8217;t do the more complex things currently but the need is going to be there - it&#8217;s only a matter of time before it is integrated into the Rails framework.</p>
<p>None of this makes my decision any easier: when I change jobs next (which still won&#8217;t be until at least summer) should I focus on a job involving Rails despite the fact that it almost certainly won&#8217;t pay as much?    I can&#8217;t help but go back to the parallel with java: I am at the top of the heap in Java because I started with it so early and have that much more experience.  Rails might involve starting over right now but if the analogy holds true (C -> Java -> Rails) switching over now will put me in the same position 8 years from now.  Is the energy and creativity that Rails gives me worth the possible pay hit to eventually leave behind J2EE - that is the crux of my dilemma.
