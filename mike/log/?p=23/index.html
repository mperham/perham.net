				<p>The Supreme Court recently heard a case which challanged the current copyright terms.  In 1996, Sonny Bono sponsored a law which extended the copyright term to life + 50 years for individuals or 95 years for corporations.  This law was primarily backed by the big Hollywood media giants in order to protect the copyrights on older resources like <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> and Mickey Mouse in <em>Steamboat Willie</em>.  In fact the copyright term has been extended several times in the last several decades - always when the copyrights on these old movies were about to expire.</p>
<p>The Constitution provides Congress with the power to establish limited terms for copyright and the plantiffs argued that Congress was essentially providing an unlimited copyright by continually extending the copyright period over the last several decades.  In fact it has been over 30 years since ANYTHING has gone into the public domain.</p>
<p>While I believe the Court was technically right in their decision (95 years is still technically limited), I believe the current situation is a gross miscarriage of the Founding Father&#8217;s intentions who initially set the copyright period to 14 years (plus another 14 year extension if desired by the copyright holder).  Copyright is intended to do one thing - provide a balance between the rights of a creator and the need for progress.  Consider the extremes: if there was no copyright everything would go into the public domain immediately and creators would have no incentive to create anything.  If copyrights never expire,  the creator&#8217;s children and grandchildren would inherit the rights and would gain much potential reward for something they did not create, thus disincenting them from creating also.  The lack of any public domain pool of art/music and its effects on society is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>
<p>A copyright is not something that should last for more than the life of the individual creator.  For corporations, something like 50 years would seem to be a reasonable limit.  By allowing a copyright to continue far beyond the original timespan, the system has tipped in favor of the copyright holders.  The American people lose, MGM and Disney wins.</p>
