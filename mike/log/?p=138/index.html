				<p>[Found on the Net - an instant classic]</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Falwell,</p>
<p>Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God&#8217;s Law. I have learned a great deal from your show, and I try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle, for example, I simply remind them that Leviticus 18:22 clearly stated it to be an abomination to the Lord. I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some of the other laws and how best to follow them:</p>
<p>A) When I burn a bull on the alter as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord (Lev. 1:9). The problem is my neighbors: they claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them?</p>
<p>B) I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in Exodus 2:17. In this day and age, what do you think a fair price for her would be?</p>
<p>C) I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual uncleanness. (Lev. 15:19-24) The problem is, how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense.</p>
<p>D) Lev. 25:44 states that I may indeed possess slaves, both male and female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify? Why can&#8217;t I own Canadians?</p>
<p>E) I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states that he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself?</p>
<p>F) A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an abomination (Lev. 11:10), it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don&#8217;t agree. Can you settle this?</p>
<p>G) Lev. 21:20 states that I may not approach the alter of the Lord if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20 or is there some wiggle room here?</p>
<p>H) Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev. 19:27. How should they die?</p>
<p>I) I know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean. May I still play football if I wear gloves?</p>
<p>J) My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev. 19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread. (It looks like some sort of cotton/poly blend.) He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? (Lev. 24:10-16) Couldn&#8217;t we just burn them to death at a private affair like we do with people who sleep with their in-laws? (Lev 20:14.)</p>
<p>I know that you have studied these things extensively, so I&#8217;m confident that you can help. Thanks for reminding us that God&#8217;s word is eternal and unchanging.
