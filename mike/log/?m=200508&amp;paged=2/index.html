					<p>This is an <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/mobile/article/0,2763,1542338,00.html">extremely scary article</a> about how at least one cell phone company in the UK has the power to know where you are and listen to your conversations by turning on the phone&#8217;s mic remotely.  I don&#8217;t think it would be outrageous to suggest that this could easily fall under Federal Wiretap laws and therefore the federal gov&#8217;t can track and listen to you just by making a wiretap request (which also became easier in 2001 with the Patriot Act).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m off to the grocery store to buy tinfoil to construct my new hat.

					<p>I should note that I had two iced coffees yesterday.  This would not normally be Mutterings-worthy save for the fact that they in all likelihood contained some small amount of Indian tap water.  Yes, I do like to like to live dangerously, especially when there is a heavenly mixture of coffee and chocolate involved.

					<p>Three of the guys from the office, Kartik Gautam and Punkaj, picked me up at noon and we headed around town.  Interestingly, they are all relatively new to the city also so we were asking directions every 5 minutes.  We drove Marine Drive (the road along the beach), saw the Gateway to India (a monument constructed upon the visit of the King and Queen of England in the 1900s), had some food at the Cafe Mondegar, did a little shopping and then headed to another part of the city to sit in a cafe and people watch (not a problem in a city of 15 million people).  During that latter time, we discovered that our car had been towed for illegal parking.  We grabbed an auto-ricksaw (a three wheeled vehicle that can hold three people + driver) and drove to the police substation to pay the fine (rs 300 or about $7).  From there we drove to a theatre in an attempt to see a play but found out that it was in a language no one understood (not unusal in a country with 13 official languages).  So we walked to the nearby beach and walked it for a bit.  At that point it was 9pm and I was pooped.  We called it an evening.

				<small>Saturday, August 27th, 2005</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Yesterday we went to a &#8220;resort&#8221; about 1.5 hours outside of Mumbai.  The difference between America and India is apparently everywhere you look.  The bus we took to the resort was smelly, beat up and the resort itself was basically two pools, a few large structures for sit down meals - nothing fancy at all (in fact pretty run down).  My point is that this is a reasonable place to hold a company picnic in India whereas in America, I&#8217;d start looking for a new job.</p>
<p>That said, I had a good time.  I left the hotel at 7am and we got there around 9:30.  We had breakfast and then played water volleyball and water polo in the pool for a few hours.  We had lunch and then played party games for prizes.  Most of the prizes were these candles made from gelatin in wine flutes.  I did not win anything throughout it all but at the end I was presented with a &#8220;special prize for Mr. Mike&#8221;.   You guessed it - a leftover gelatin candle.  It&#8217;s a beautiful candle so I was content.  In the end, I was exhausted from the long day and got back at the hotel at 8:30pm barely able to stay awake.</p>
<p>Some of the folks here are impressed with my natural affinity for Indian food.  I told them my diet in Austin was pretty pathetic (two words: tofu dogs) and so they are planning on sending me back home with a bunch of food that I can try out and possibly buy at Indian grocery stores in Austin.  Yum.</p>
<p>Today we are going to go shopping and see a little bit more of the downtown area.  Mumbai is a lot like Manhattan - a thin peninsula oriented North-South.  Well our office is located equivalent to a little north of midtown and we are going to head down to the equivalent of Wall St, to the tip of the island where the &#8220;money&#8221; lives and works.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been taking lots of pictures but the internet connection is not terribly fast so everything will have to wait until I get home.

					<p>The closest place I have ever been to India before is Zimbabwe.  It&#8217;s a bit unreal to be honest.  The traffic is everything they say: there&#8217;s no lanes, potholes are more like small wells, there&#8217;s traffic 6 inches away on both sides and I don&#8217;t believe we got above 25 mph during the drive.</p>
<p>The hotel is ok but I am a little disappointed for a &#8220;5-star&#8221; hotel.  The public areas and food are fantastic but the room is mediocre.  The bed is just a fitted sheet and duvet.  The AC seems to add, not remove, humidity.  The internet access is pretty slow and costs $100/week.  The TV is your standard, crappy 20&#8243;.</p>
<p>I gave a presentation on Hibernate yesterday seemed to help some people.  It was entitled &#8220;Advanced Hibernate&#8221; and half of the room had not used Hibernate before.  Sigh.  Rule one of giving a presentation: make sure you know your audience and craft it for them.  I didn&#8217;t realize we had hired so many new developers in the last 2-3 months.</p>
<p>I also interviewed a fellow who was a &#8220;Senior Developer&#8221; at Oracle India and was asking for a pretty good salary.  Asked him to define recursion.  No idea.  Asked him what his favorite data structure is.  No idea.  Ding, have a nice day.</p>
<p>More of the same expected today.

					<p>Wow, for once I had an actual good time at Gingerman last night.  I believe it was simply a case of mixing in several people who I did not know along with the <a href="http://yinsight.blogspot.com">usual</a> <a href="http://www.primozich.com">suspects</a>.  Thanks especially to Mr. Yin for inviting me (I know you really didn&#8217;t want to).</p>
<p>Of course, I really could have done without the loud drunk guy who sat down next to me and proceed to expound upon many a vile and unspeakable topic.  But in the end, even he added a certain foul zest to the evening that made it unique.  Let&#8217;s do it again soon fellas.

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I have passed into the realm of Hard Drive pack rat.  A quick mental estimate puts the number of hard drives in my house at 8, with a ninth on the way.  I&#8217;ve got 3 Maxtor drives at 40, 40 and 60GB in size which I need to get rid of.  The old 40GB goes for free - it was made in 1999 so it will probably turn to dust the minute you touch it.  The new 40GB goes for $5 or one beer.  60GB for $10 or two beers.  I suggest you wipe the drive after getting it - you never know <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=donkey+porn">what it might contain</a>.
