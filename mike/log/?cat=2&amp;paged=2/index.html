				<div class="entry">
					<p>At Webify, we have three main subsystems of our applications: Hibernate for the database layer, Spring for the component container layer and Tapestry for the Web UI layer.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s relatively easy to unit test Hibernate and Spring code via JUnit, they both provide hooks so you can start them up by hand.  Tapestry, on the other hand, is meant to run within an application server - it requires a container to run.  Well, mock objects have recently become popular as a way of testing code which requires a container to run; you just create the container objects which are used by this code so that it thinks it is running within a container:</p>
<pre>
        MockServletContext servCtx = new MockServletContext("/webroot");
        MockServletConfig servCfg = new MockServletConfig(servCtx, "tapestry");
        ApplicationServlet servlet = new ApplicationServlet();
        servlet.init(servCfg);

        MockHttpServletRequest req = new MockHttpServletRequest(servCtx, "GET", "/");
        MockHttpServletResponse resp = new MockHttpServletResponse();
        servlet.service(req, resp);
        if (!pageRequested) {
            fail("Home page was not executed");
        }
</pre>
<p>The ApplicationServlet is the method of entry into the Tapestry system.  On the filesystem, you create a &#8220;tapestry.application&#8221; file in webroot/WEB-INF which contains the page definitions.  In this case, this just tests that the Home page is rendered.</p>
<pre>
public class HomePage extends BasePage implements PageRenderListener {
    public void pageBeginRender(PageEvent arg0) {
        RequestTest.setPageRequested();
    }
}
</pre>
<p>Pretty simple, huh?  Now we can do basic login testing as part of our unit tests to ensure that the Web UI actually works, rather than needing to run a container and testing it by hand!

					<p>I received a rude shock this week when porting our new application from <a href="http://www.caucho.com">Resin</a> to <a href="http://www.ibm.com/websphere">Websphere</a>.  The way we were doing asynchronous JMS messaging was completely forbidden in Websphere and requires a major rearchitecture of the application.   As a side effect, we also need to use Websphere everywhere - not just in production but also in development on our own machines.</p>
<p>This wouldn&#8217;t be a problem if Websphere was good software.  The problem is that it is not.  It is absolutely terrible from a development perspective as it forces you to work the way it wants to, not the way you want to.  I also never thought I&#8217;d say this but it is incredibly <b>over-documented</b>.  Everything has 300 pages of documentation to go along with it but everything is so poorly indexed that you can&#8217;t find the one piece of documentation you want.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m wondering if 30 years from now I will be a Willy Loman-type figure, slouched over and beaten down by decades of abuse at the hands of the most evil software ever created.  God help my soul.

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I spent all day today teaching myself how to build a Web Service client using VB.NET.  Webify&#8217;s technology is all Java-based on the server side but pretty much all of our customers are using .NET on the desktop to call our web services.  Unfortunately most of them are not incredibly tech-savvy, especially when it comes to cutting edge stuff like web services.  Thus they&#8217;ve been struggling to come on board while our deadline fast approaches&#8230;  &lt;cue omnious music&gt;  So I bit the bullet and spent the day figuring out how to call our services using VB.NET so we can provide them with working sample code to integrate with their systems.  </p>
<p>The actual web service is relatively straightforward - MS has good support for document/literal services so that was not a problem.  The problem was the SOAP headers we require to do authentication and service routing.  It turns out that adding custom SOAP headers to .NET is relatively straightforward - you just create a class which mocks the header.  For each element, create a property.  You use XML serialization attributes to control how those properties are serialized to XML (i.e. the local name and namespace).  Once I realized that, it was simple enough to create the headers we require.

					<p>I&#8217;ve been using cvs at every single job for the last 5 years.  It works and it&#8217;s really stable but it&#8217;s got some annoying &#8220;features&#8221;: most notably, it does not version file and directory names so if you just want to change the name of a directory or file, you need to delete the old one (and its contents) and add one with the new name (and its contents).  In the process, you lose your revision history.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">subversion</a>.  I just tried it out today and I like it.  Frankly I love the simple zen of cvs on the command line and subversion does nothing to change that - it is trivial to use on the command line and has a laundry list of features above and beyond what cvs provides (including directory versioning).  Here&#8217;s hoping every future job will use svn instead.

					<p>Here&#8217;s an article on the new intelligent filesystem, <a href="http://www6.tomshardware.com/storage/20040129/index.html">WinFS</a>, slated to appear in the next version of Windows.  My favorite quote:</p>
<p>&#8220;From the user&#8217;s standpoint, items degrade the files&#8217; physical storage location to the point of insignificance. Instead, Windows organizes the data according to content in virtual folders. In searching for these data, user-based criteria such as &#8220;All vacation pics of the last two years&#8221; replace details such as file format, author and storage location.&#8221;</p>
<p>So instead of depending on the user to intelligently catalog the pictures using folders (i.e. &#8220;My Documents\My Pictures\{2002, 2003, etc}&#8221;), it requires the user to catagorize the pictures using some other undefined means.  I&#8217;m all for progress but it ain&#8217;t hard to catagorize pictures using folders now.  Instead I think this is a facility that belongs at the application layer where an application will know a lot more about the format and datatypes of the files.  Take email - Outlook does a great job at indexing and allowing one to search through years of emails to find that email from some distant relative.  Leaving it to the OS will just slow down the whole process and require more powerful hardware.

				<small>Thursday, January 8th, 2004</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>I&#8217;ve been playing around with some new networking technoglogies (i.e. newer than Berkeley sockets).  In no particular order:</p>
<p><UL><br />
<LI><b>Rendezvous</b> - a simple but effective <a href="http://developer.apple.com/macosx/rendezvous">new technology</a> from Apple.  It allows a machine to discover other services on the network through the use of multicast packets broadcast to a well-known multicast group.  Breaks service discovery into types and instances so you can either find all types of services on your network, find all instances of a type or a particular instance.  It should be noted that this only deals with discovery - the endpoints still must understand how to talk to each other.  It is based on an IETF standard (mDNS) and is language-independent.</p>
<li><b>JXTA</b> - a much more complicated and powerful technology.  JXTA is a <a href="http://www.jxta.org">p2p-based technology</a> which allows peers to disccover and communicate with each other.  It means to be language-independent but is essentially tied to Java right now.
<li><b>jini</b> - jini is a distributed network programming foundation for Java.  It is a few years old and has pretty much fallen out of favor due to the rise of web services and its heavy dependence on Java.
</ul>
<p>Rendezvous is very exciting to me.  We are starting to see many, if not most, new consumer electronics with some network capability.  The ability to discover and manage these devices without some complicated setup will be critical to their success.  Tivo has already announced that future Tivos will be Rendezvous aware so that Macs can find and view shows recorded on the Tivo with just a few  mouse clicks.</p>
<p>JXTA would make a great foundation for the next P2P application, like Napster or Skype.  Microsoft has an equivalent .NET P2P foundation available to developers.

					<p>This week at work was madness.  We had a deadline Friday morning to demo a new application for a large customer.  We knew it was going to be down to the wire to get everything working but we forgot about Murphy&#8217;s Law.  We have four American developers and 6 Indian developers, all of who have been in the US for the last month to work on this project.  One developer left last week due to child birth, another had health issues and missed the last three days.  A third had to leave a day early due to poor planning when buying his ticket several months ago.  On top of that, our network at work went down for several hours Thursday night due to an Ethernet cable with both ends plugged into the same hub (we think it caused some sort of feedback loop and generated random packets).  This meant that the rest of us spent 30 hours straight working from Thursday morning until Friday noon without sleep.  And we didn&#8217;t meet the deadline.  Very disappointing.  At least I&#8217;m off for the next ten days&#8230;
