				<p>England has a substantial Muslim community including several &#8220;rabid&#8221; clerics.  So the London tube bombings, while horrible, were not any particular surprise especially given England&#8217;s support with the US in Iraq.  My question: is France or the Netherlands next?  Both also have large Muslim communities with alarming trends in radicalism popping up recently.  In France they just expelled a radical cleric accused of holding a terrorist training camp west of Paris and in the Netherlands, a radical Muslim killed the director of a short film which painted the Muslim religion as being misogynist.  As the European community will support England in no uncertain terms, it is inevitable that some in those Muslim communities will see this support as making the current &#8220;Us vs Them&#8221; situation even worse.</p>
<p>All of these communities have the same makeup: they are tight-knit religious communities where many of the  members rarely associate outside the community.  They do not get to know the country&#8217;s people at an individual level but through ignorance and generalization, develop a hatred of the host country&#8217;s mores and people.  I can&#8217;t help but believe that in a few years the current &#8220;Terrorists vs the US&#8221; will become a more widespread &#8220;Terrorists vs the West&#8221;.  It&#8217;s going to get worse before it gets better.
