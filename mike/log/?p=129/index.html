			<div class="entrytext">
				<p>Tonight I came across one of those programming questions which is easy to pose but maddeningly difficult to solve.  I&#8217;m trying to burn a DVD (which is limited to 4.5GB) with a set of 11 videos which total about 6.6GB and individually range in size from 550MB to 750MB.  The problem is: given a set of N file sizes, find a subset which total closest to the magical 4.5GB number without going over.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t about to figure out all the permutations myself (with 11 files you have 2^11 permutations, although many of them are trivial to discard).  Now it&#8217;s been years since I&#8217;ve been in school but my initial thought was this is a perfect example of a <a href="http://www.nist.gov/dads/HTML/dynamicprog.html">dynamic programming</a> problem but as my skills are not as sharp as they used to be, I&#8217;m still unclear how to turn this notion into an efficient implementation.</p>
<p>So I went back to the drawing board and realized that the calculations I want to perform can be represented as a bitmask from 1 to 2^N where each bit represents whether to add the number at that index to the total.  Let&#8217;s say I have 3 file sizes and want to total as close to 18 as possible:</p>
<p>14<br />
3<br />
12</p>
<p>There are 8 possibilities:</p>
<p>000 = 0<br />
001 = 14<br />
010 = 3<br />
011 = 17<br />
100 = 12<br />
101 = 26<br />
110 = 15<br />
111 = 29</p>
<p>And so the answer is 011 = 17.  My size optimizer handles up to 32 sizes (due to an int having 32 bits).  I can&#8217;t imagine wanting to fit more than about 20 shows on a DVD so that should be sufficient.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s my algorithm.  It&#8217;s NP-complete, running in O(2^N) time unfortunately but that&#8217;s required to find the optimal fit.
