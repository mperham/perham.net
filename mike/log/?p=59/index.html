				<p>I got the HDTV box Monday afternoon and had quite a time trying to get all the local stations on my cheap antenna.  I already had a cable run from the attic since I had envisioned having an HD antenna a few months ago when I was wiring my system.  I bought a little dohickey to link the antenna and the cable and hooked that up to the box and WHAMMO! I now have all three HD stations broadcasting in Austin.</p>
<p>It was a pain in the butt to set up the wiring for the components though.  My receiver only has two digital optical inputs and I have three optical components: Tivo, DVD and HDTV box.  Thus my DVD player has been rendered mute.  I mainly use it for playing CDs and I have a little MP3 CD player also hooked up so it shouldn&#8217;t be that big of a deal.  Maybe a year from now I&#8217;ll pick up an HD Tivo (with DVD built in?) which will consolidate much of this mess into a neater package.</p>
<p>So the question on everyone&#8217;s minds: how&#8217;s the HD quality?  Pretty good - it&#8217;s a very noticable improvement over standard definition.  Becky and I did an A/B test with Leno last night and her comment?  &#8220;You can see the color of his eyes!&#8221;  &#8216;Nuff said.
