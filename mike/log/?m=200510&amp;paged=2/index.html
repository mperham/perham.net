				<div class="entry">
					<p>My disenchantment with my job grows daily.  The more I use Rails, the more I dislike the absolute mountain of crap that is J2EE.  Certainly I want to do the best I can for Webify but there is no joy in working with J2EE anymore.</p>
<p>So I face quite the quandary: J2EE pays very well.  I have been working with Java for 8 years now, have lots of experience and I am essentially at the top of the pecking order of engineers at my current job.  To leave the J2EE world would seem to be career suicide.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I started out writing C in Unix and when Java came out, I saw what an amazing productivity increase it gave to developers.  So I jumped onto it as quickly as possible and never looked back - it allowed me to focus on writing applications and not have to worry about misc crap like memory management.  Remember how Java initially started out as a language for applets and OS-independent GUI applications but really picked up steam when people realized how powerful it was for building web applications?  I see the same trend with Ruby and Rails.  Ruby is 10 years old but really didn&#8217;t get much momentum until Rails came along.  The two combined give such a productivity increase to the average web developer that I can&#8217;t help but think that Rails is the wedge that will eventually drive more and more developers away from their current stacks of choice because it is simply head and shoulders more productive than anything else.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, Java has seen an incredible adoption rate but with that success has come bureaucracy, enterprise baggage and a larger and larger set of requirements just to get a simple dynamic web application working.  A reasonable java web application requires maven, hibernate, spring, tapestry, tomcat, cactus, junit, eclipse, the 20-30 dependencies that they bring in recursively and mountains of XML configuration to tie them all together.  And that doesn&#8217;t even cover message queuing, asynchronous scheduling and other, more complex areas of J2EE.</p>
<p>Rails has the simple stuff all integrated into one seamless package.  It doesn&#8217;t do the more complex things currently but the need is going to be there - it&#8217;s only a matter of time before it is integrated into the Rails framework.</p>
<p>None of this makes my decision any easier: when I change jobs next (which still won&#8217;t be until at least summer) should I focus on a job involving Rails despite the fact that it almost certainly won&#8217;t pay as much?    I can&#8217;t help but go back to the parallel with java: I am at the top of the heap in Java because I started with it so early and have that much more experience.  Rails might involve starting over right now but if the analogy holds true (C -> Java -> Rails) switching over now will put me in the same position 8 years from now.  Is the energy and creativity that Rails gives me worth the possible pay hit to eventually leave behind J2EE - that is the crux of my dilemma.

					<p>Well, I&#8217;ve hemmed and hawwed (?) the other way now: Rails is back.  I&#8217;ve given up on Java and restarted my project in Ruby on Rails.  Now I have a decent IDE in <a href="http://www.radrails.org">Radrails</a> so I&#8217;m hopeful that I will be a little more productive than on the Mac Mini with vi.  I can already see some amazing productivity improvements - bug fixing is painless with Ruby&#8217;s complete lack of a deployment step.  It took me about 10 minutes to create and debug a login page with the code located at the <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/Authentication">bottom of this page</a>.

					<p>DARPA&#8217;s <a href="http://www.grandchallenge.org/">Grand Challenge</a> was held today.  Team Cornell didn&#8217;t made it 9 miles into the course but I am happy to say that Princeton didn&#8217;t make it any further and Caltech only made it 8 miles.  So far only Stanford and both CMU teams have finished.  As a side note, Flash is highly annoying and has many problems - one of them being that I can&#8217;t link to specific content within the site.

					<p>I&#8217;ve been messing with <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> and their <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/webtools/">WebTools Project</a> for the last few nights.  In theory it sounds like a great idea: integrate the container into the IDE so that you can edit your project source and publish (aka hot deploy) those changes directly to the container for testing.  J2EE is infamous for its painfully long deployment cycles which make it a nightmare to build the UI layers of a web application.  Fix a typo, wait 2 minutes for the build and deploy to finish, test your app for 30 seconds, find another typo, repeat.  It&#8217;s a mind-numbing process and has probably spurred on billions in hardware upgrade sales.  WTP does not completely solve the issues but it does promised to reduce the cycle time by integrating with the container as closely as possible to minimize deployment time.</p>
<p>So all good in theory.  I downloaded the latest stable build, 1.0M8, released about two weeks ago and installed it into Fedora&#8217;s native eclipse.  It promptly broke, probably because it requires a very current set of dependencies.  Ok, my fault!  I downloaded the latest version of Eclipse, 3.1.1, along with a set of additional plugins required by WTP.  Everything installs cleanly.  Now my project uses Subversion for source control so I downloaded Subclipse and installed it.  As soon as Eclipse restarted, it was hosed.  Sigh.  I reinstalled everything and made a backup of working Eclipse install.  So I tried to install Spring-IDE.  Hosed.  I tried to install the latest updates for those additional plugins mentioned above.  Hosed.  Ok, so WTP is really, really finicky; I&#8217;ll deal with it and live without those plugins.  It takes me several hours to get my current project recognized as a WTP  Dynamic Web Project.  Thankfully someone <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MPECLIPSE-80">patched the maven eclipse plugin</a> to generate the .wtpmodule file required.</p>
<p>We use <a href="http://www.devx.com/ibmrational/Article/27796/2046">Rational Software Architect</a> at my workplace and recently purchased about 50 licenses.  I won&#8217;t say what we paid but its a lot more than free.  RSA is based on Eclipse 3.0 (i.e. about a year old now) but IBM added their own version of WTP that works with WebSphere and a substantial set of modeling and visualization tools on top of Eclipse to justify the expense.  All of this works really seamlessly - I recently discovered the WTP integration and found that it cut my deployment time in half.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Eclipse and WTP does not currently work nearly as smoothly as RSA.  You have the incredible fragility of the install, the system seems to pause for 15-30 seconds at times and the container integration is still not as smooth as with RSA.  That&#8217;s why companies pay for commercial software - sometimes open source software is stable and just as good as its commercial bretheren but all too often it is not.  RSA is one example where paying some bucks will ultimately make developers more productive.
