			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Austin currently has thousands of condo units currently under development in the downtown area and it looks like this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/17/business/17investors.html?pagewanted=all">trend holds true </a>around the rest of the nation also.  I think as supply grows and interest rates rise over the next year or two, the hot condo market downtown will cool and prices will actually drop.  This market feels like a bubble just like in 2000 and the best time to buy stock was in 2002.  So come 2008 I may be buying a condo.

		<description><![CDATA[So far I&#8217;ve learned that curling is not a sport. Chess is not a sport. They both take skill but if you don&#8217;t break a sweat, it&#8217;s not a sport.
I&#8217;m hoping to win the gold medal in computer programming in 08.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, as you might imagine, Dad and I have both been swept up <a href="http://www.websudoku.com">Sudoku</a>, the new puzzle craze.  I spent 90 minutes yesterday attempting to finish an Evil puzzle and got 10 numbers filled in before giving up.  If you can finish an Evil puzzle (no cheating), post up so I can be secretly jealous of your super skills.</p>
<p>UPDATE: I finished my first Evil Sudoku in 58 minutes.  They say the average time is 17 minutes.  Uh huh.

The result is that the president&#8217;s wartime powers, with its armies, battles, victories, and congressional declarations, now extend to the rhetorical &#8220;War on Terror&#8221;: a war with no fronts, no boundaries, no opposing army, and &#8212; most ominously &#8212; no knowable &#8220;victory.&#8221; Investigations, arrests and trials are not tools of war.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This according to Bruce Schneier:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The result is that the president&#8217;s wartime powers, with its armies, battles, victories, and congressional declarations, now extend to the rhetorical &#8220;War on Terror&#8221;: a war with no fronts, no boundaries, no opposing army, and &#8212; most ominously &#8212; no knowable &#8220;victory.&#8221; Investigations, arrests and trials are not tools of war. But according to the Yoo memo, the president can define war however he chooses, and remain &#8220;at war&#8221; for as long as he chooses.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is precisely what I was getting at when I blogged about the nonsensical &#8220;War on Terror&#8221;.</p>
<blockquote><p>
This is indefinite dictatorial power. And I don&#8217;t use that term lightly; the very definition of a dictatorship is a system that puts a ruler above the law. In the weeks after 9/11, while America and the world were grieving, Bush built a legal rationale for a dictatorship. Then he immediately started using it to avoid the law.
</p></blockquote>
