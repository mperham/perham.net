<p>So I wore my Death mask to work today but it was friday so I wore my hawaiian shirt too.  I told everyone I was going as "Death on vacation" but all my coworkers have decided I'm "gay Skeletor".</p>

<h3 class="title">Ok, that's it...</h3>

<p><a href="http://gallery.sf.net">Gallery</a> is now officially the coolest software in the world.  Not only is it free, well documented, easy to use and open source but it also integrates with the Windows XP Web Publishing Wizard so creating a new photo album and uploading the photos to it is literally 1-2-3 point and click.  I just donated money to them - is there any higher praise than when someone volunteers to give you money?</p>

<p>Anyone out there in blog land know of a decent PHP Photo Album program?  I've tried 2-3 of the top ones (PHPix, Slooze) and they all have one problem or another.  Very frustrating.</p>

<h3 class="title">Track Day Results</h3>

<p>Well, I'm back from the track.  I hit my goal of a 2:30 laptime so I'm happy.  That's a moderate pace compared to the veterans but seemed pretty fast to me!  Next spring I'll try to get down to 2:25 or 2:20.  One thing I noticed is that group 1 is starting to get too slow for me.  I might need to move up to group 2 where more people are lapping at 2:20 instead of 2:40...</p>

<p>Holy cow.  I just installed phpBB and I have got to say I was blown away at how easy it is to install.  I literally filled in 5-10 text fields and it did everything else without a single problem.  Top notch!</p>

<p>At any rate, check it out:</p>

<h3 class="title">Database</h3>

<p>Excellent!  My web hosting service, <a href="http://www.pair.com">pair.com</a>, just increased my disk space allowance to 500MB and gave me one mysql database.  Now I can add database-driven applications to my site.</p>

<p>Pair.com is highly recommended for anyone looking for a good hosting service.  The price has not increased a dime in 5 years and they regularly increase disk space and bandwidth allowances as their wholesale cost decreases.</p>

<h3 class="title">More intellectual property shenanigans...</h3>

<p>This treaty would make it possible to send non-commercial copyright infringers to <b>prison</b> for using p2p systems.  If you downloaded a few tracks off of Kazaa, you can be convicted of a <b>felony</b> and go to jail!</p>

<p><i>As of October 2003, an estimated 60 million Americans use P2P file-sharing software in the US alone and the number of overseas users is even higher. This level of civil disobedience sends the crystal clear message that intellectual property laws are in stark contrast with the will of the people and should be changed to clearly legalize P2P file-sharing. Without the consent of the governed, FTAA's policies have no legitimate place in an international treaty between democracies. </i></p>

<h3 class="title">Good Book</h3>

<p>I checked out a book from the library they had on their "What's New" list.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0061020257/qid=1066222964/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/002-8867989-5383210?v=glance&s=books">Metaplanetary</a> by Tony Daniel is FANTASTIC so far.  I do agree with some of the minor quibbles posted in the Amazon reviews (specifically the first chapter or two are not very involving) but the book quickly sinks its hooks into you and doesn't let go.  I'm only about half way through but I can't wait to read the rest...</p>

<h3 class="title">Microsoft and Vodafone's new services standards</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.webservices.org/index.php/article/articleview/1203/1/2/">http://www.webservices.org/index.php/article/articleview/1203/1/2/</a></p>

<p>The executive summary is that Vodafone and MS are partnering to create standards for the use of Web Services over a GSM network.  I think this is a poor choice in the long run - tying it to the GSM network just means that the cell carrier will charge the hell out of it and no one will use it.  See GPRS for a current example.</p>

<p>There's a better solution: Wi-Fi integration.  Every coffee house, hotel, airport, etc has a wireless hotspot these days and they will only get more prevelant.  It provides a free network connection (the pay-per-use hotspots will go the way of the dinosaur in a year or two) and from there, additional protocols can be created to solve higher-level problems through standards bodies like the W3C or IETF.</p>

<p>Another thought: consider the rising demand for Voice over IP (VOIP).  How long do you think it will take before someone offers an Wi-Fi handset that works without wires like a <a href="http://www.sipphone.com">SIPPhone</a>?  It's not going kill off the cell phone but certain market segments might find it cheaper.</p>

<h3 class="title">Microsoft and I agree on something</h3>

<p>From <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnwebsrv/html/rpc_literal.asp#rpc_literal_topic3">http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnwebsrv/html/rpc_literal.asp#rpc_literal_topic3</a>:</p>

<p><b>WS-I Basic Profile and RPC/literal</b></p>

<p>"Unfortunately, the WS-I Basic Profile explicitly permits the use of both document/literal and RPC/literal. Given the above analysis, I believe having two message formats is unnecessary and ultimately does not help interoperability. Hopefully, most if not all Web service developers will ignore RPC/literal and provide the necessary feedback to WS-I to fix this in a future version of the Basic Profile. "</p>

<p>This is exactly the point I made a month ago.</p>

<h3 class="title">Websphere</h3>

<p>Through my career, I've used pretty much every major Java app server: Weblogic, jboss, tomcat, dynamo, and resin.  The only one I haven't used is IBM's Websphere, until now.  Webify deploys all of its solutions on Websphere and DB2.  And for the most part, Websphere is garbage.</p>

<p>Understand my viewpoint: to me the app server must allow me to quickly write, compile, deploy and test my applications.  The middle two steps are almost always controlled by a build process consisting of ant or maven and the design of the app server dictates how easy or difficult application deployment is.  The problem is that Webspshere takes the aproach that the developer is an idiot and needs a pretty GUI wizard to deploy the application.  This is great for documentation and demos but it is absolutely abysmal for the productivity of a professional developer.  Indeed  fixing a bug in a piece of code might take 10 seconds to fix and another 10 seconds to compile but with Websphere it takes another minute or two to walk through the stupid deployment wizard in order to test the fix.</p>

<p>The smaller app servers do not have this problem.  For the most part they are designed and written by professional developers who understand that a good app server compliments a developer by allowing as much to be automated as possible.  With resin, I can fix, compile and deploy an application in seconds rather than minutes.  For this reason, the big app servers like Websphere and Weblogic (which pander to the managers and have thousands of superfluous features) will never have the developer mindshare that app servers like jboss and resin do (which do their job with a minimum of fuss).</p>
