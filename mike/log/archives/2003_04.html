<h3 class="title">Red Bull Flugtag</h3>

<p>So myself and a bunch of my friends went to the <a href="http://www.redbullflugtag.com/">Red Bull Flugtag</a> yesterday.  The basic premise behind this event is people making large random objects that they accelerate off a ramp in the hopes that it will fly a good distance before crashing into a body of water.  "Good" in this instance is used extremely loosely as the objects are often times more silly than aerodynamic, which is usually the point.</p>

<p>Highlights of this Flugtag included the following flying objects: an alien sombero, a flying V guitar, a bowl of chips and salsa, a giant "Bevo" (the UT mascot), Snoopy's doghouse, Mary Poppins' umbrella, etc.</p>

<p>We had a great time - it was just hilarious to watch these people fling themselves off a 30 foot tower and oftentimes plummet straight down into Town Lake.  Next time we'll remember to bring chairs and an umbrella for the sun.  They estimated the crowd at 40,000.  I believe it - it was packed.</p>

<p>First picture is Becky with the intrepid pilot of the Flying V.  Rock on, man.  Unforunately he broke his shoulder when he crashed into one of the pickups while falling into the water.  Second picture is the chips and salsa as it falls off the ramp into the water.</p>

<h3 class="title">It's tough to find good help</h3>

<p>I finally hired a maid and butler to handle the boring chores around the house.  The first thing I did was put them to work washing my car.  Here's a picture:</p>

<h3 class="title">No Joy in Muddville...</h3>

<p>Cornell lost 3-2 against Univ of NH yesterday.  They were down 3-0 and staged quite the comeback to 3-2 but couldn't get that final goal necessary to tie.  Better luck next year guys!</p>

<h3 class="title">Happenings</h3>

<p>Well I got two deliveries Monday night.  First was my new Dell Latitude D600 laptop.  So far I am very happy with it - it lasts forever (6-8 hrs in practice) on two batteries and runs relatively cool.</p>

<p>Next was my parents showing up a day early.  They've helped me decorate a little, perform some minor botanical surgery on one of my sick plants and shop for some new furniture.  We plan to attend the Arts Festival downtown this weekend and perhaps pick up a work of art or two.</p>

<h3 class="title">At the Track again</h3>

<p>I spent another Monday at Texas World Speedway in College Station at a trackday put on by <a href="http://www.ridesmart.info">RideSmart</a>.  The first time I didn't enjoy myself too much but this time I had a blast.  I camped there Sunday night and it was a bit cold (mid 30s) but my new tent and sleeping bag performed admirably.</p>

<p>The weather was clear and cool, perfect for racing around in leathers.  I had a friend time a few laps during my first session and she timed me at 3:00, 2:50 and 2:47.  The lap record is 1:44.  :)  I'm just sorry we didn't get any times from my last session where I would have been more comfortable (and thus faster).  I'm sure I beat my own goal of 2:45.</p>

<p>Here's the pictures of me.  A little better than the set from Nov but still no kneedragging...</p>
