<h3 class="title">New Laptop</h3>

<p>Well, the old laptop is quickly fading so I needed to buy a new laptop.  I bought a Dell Latitude D600 but it isn't supposed to ship until April 8th.  Let's hope the current machine lasts that long.  It's a Pentium M 1.4Ghz with 640MB RAM and 40GB HD.</p>

<h3 class="title">Microsoft .NET</h3>

<p>I've been using Visual Studio.NET for a short project I recently started.  So far it's been a mixed experience - the C# and ASP code is fairly similar to Java and JSP so it's not difficult to understang how things work.  One thing I have grown used to over the last few months is a clean and simple IDE that makes writing the code simple and I'm not too impressed with the VS.NET IDE.  The best java IDE available is called IDEA and is extremely powerful and easy to use in that it helps a developer write code faster and doesn't attempt to do things like GUI building (which is really hard to do well).  Instead of a clean and simple interface, VS.NET presents the developer with a complex mess of a GUI with 50 buttons, 5 different windows, 100+ menu items and 1000s of help items covering everything from text editing to database design to GUI building but none of which seem to be what you are looking for.</p>

<p>I dream of a day where Microsoft adds five features to a release that are implemented thoroughly and simply instead of fifty features, 45 of which will never be used.  You can say the same for any software product: VS.NET, Word, Windows itself.</p>

<h3 class="title">Vacation</h3>

<p>Becky and I just got back from vacation.  Since she's still in school, we waited until spring break and took a week to drive around New Mexico and see the various sights.  Here's the basic itinerary:</p>

<p> - Carlsbad Caverns</p>

<p>Truly a natural wonder.  A must see if you are in the area.</p>

<p> - Snowboarding in Ruidioso</p>

<p>We signed up for beginner lessons as I had only boarded once and Becky never had.  The lessons were tough and we tired quickly because of the 10,000 ft altitude.  On top of that, I got sunburned on my neck and ears and both of us were terribly sore for three days afterward.  Much of the soreness was due to the fact that we were falling down every 10 feet.  Towards the end of the day I was doing runs with only 1-2 falls which were much more fun and relaxing.</p>

<p> - White Sands and Alamagordo</p>

<p>These dunes are spectacular in that they don't seem to belong.  Also worth seeing.  Alamagordo has a nice space museum worth seeing.</p>

<p> - Albuquerque</p>

<p>We visited downtown (not much going on at 7pm on a Tuesday!), Old Town, the art museum, the natural history museum and the aquarium/botantical gardens.  If I had to give them thumbs up/down, here's my call: down, down, up, up and way up.  The aquarium and gardens were fabulous; I've seen a few aquariums in my day so I went in with the attitude of "ho-hum, another aquarium..." but I was blown away by the exhibits.</p>

<p> - Visiting Becky's Aunt Pam</p>

<p>Not much to say: good food and good folks.</p>

<p> - Santa Fe</p>

<p>Santa Fe turned out to just be a quick stop so we could get back to Austin that night.  We strolled around the Plaza, saw the "miraculous" staircase in the local chapel and Becky bought some jewelry for herself.  We then headed out and drove about 800 miles in 13 hours to get into Austin at 1am.  In all we put 2100 miles on our rented minivan during the week.</p>

<p>I couldn't use my digital camera due to various issues so the pictures will take a while to get up.  I'll let you know when they are ready.</p>

<h3 class="title">Rejetting the Bike</h3>

<p>I had the boys at <a href="http://www.af1racing.com">AF1 Racing</a> noodle around inside my SV650S this week in order to clean up the throttle response and hopefully make the power a little more linear. Previously it bogged down, like most bikes, around 4-5k. (In case people didn't know, 5k rpm is where some gov't tests are run so most bikes are detuned at that point to pass noise/emission regs).</p>

<p>Well I got the bike back today and WOW, what a difference. I had installed a Scorpion slipon exhaust last year and didn't notice any changes in power. But with the rejetting, the bike definitely pulls harder and sounds killer - roll ons are much more fun now.</p>

<p>They ran it on a dyno to see the change in horsepower.  The bike now makes 60hp where it previously peaked at 58hp.  It may not sound like a lot but I can feel it when I bust the throttle wide open.</p>
