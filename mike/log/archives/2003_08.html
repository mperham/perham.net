<h3 class="title">In living color</h3>

<p>I got the HDTV box Monday afternoon and had quite a time trying to get all the local stations on my cheap antenna.  I already had a cable run from the attic since I had envisioned having an HD antenna a few months ago when I was wiring my system.  I bought a little dohickey to link the antenna and the cable and hooked that up to the box and WHAMMO! I now have all three HD stations broadcasting in Austin.</p>

<p>It was a pain in the butt to set up the wiring for the components though.  My receiver only has two digital optical inputs and I have three optical components: Tivo, DVD and HDTV box.  Thus my DVD player has been rendered mute.  I mainly use it for playing CDs and I have a little MP3 CD player also hooked up so it shouldn't be that big of a deal.  Maybe a year from now I'll pick up an HD Tivo (with DVD built in?) which will consolidate much of this mess into a neater package.</p>

<p>So the question on everyone's minds: how's the HD quality?  Pretty good - it's a very noticable improvement over standard definition.  Becky and I did an A/B test with Leno last night and her comment?  "You can see the color of his eyes!"  'Nuff said.</p>

<h3 class="title">New Toys</h3>

<p>It's been months since I bought any toys for myself.  I've been dying to upgrade my 3-yr old Nokia 8260 cell phone and buy a high definition decoder so I can take advantage of my home theatre system.  It just so happened that I bought both of them Wednesday.  I bought a <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/us/spg.jsp?template=PS1&B=ie&PID=10055&LM=PSM_V&gal=105">Sony Ericsson T616</a> phone through AT&T Wireless and a used Samsung SIR-T151 through eBay.</p>

<p>The phone has a camera built into it, a huge color screen but is still the same size as my 8260 - amazing!  So far, so good.  UPS still has the HiDef box - I'll report more when I get it hooked up.</p>

<h3 class="title">SpamAssassin scores</h3>

<p>I remember back in the day when I first installed SpamAssassin, I got a spam that scored in the high 50s.  I can't imagine what you have to do to get a score of 130!</p>

<h3 class="title">Patent Pending</h3>

<p>I'm working on some new ideas and algorithms involving web services and data transformations.  Webify is planning on patenting this work - it's esoteric but pretty cool nonetheless!</p>
