<h3 class="title">Perham... Mike Perham</h3>

<p>Work was a half day today as my company decided to have a company Thanksgiving lunch.  Afterwards no one was in the mood to work so we all left early.  Becky came to lunch and afterwards we decided to go see the new Jame Bond film <i>Die Another Day</i>.  I was actually pretty impressed.  It's very entertaining and the plot is intricate and actually makes sense in an over-the-top Hollywood sort of way.</p>

<h3 class="title">Ducati</h3>

<p>Ducati, for those of you who don't know, is essentially the Ferrari of the motorcycle world.  They make expensive sport bikes that have a very good racing pedigree.  Their current flagship bike, the 998, is arguably the best looking bike on the roads today:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.ducati.com/docs_eng/photogalleries2/998/images/f4.jpg"></p>

<p>With 2003 they are introducing a totally redesigned model, the 999.  Too bad it's hideous.  <a href="http://www.ducati.com/bikes/my2003/ducatiModel.jhtml?modelName=999-03">Go here</a> for more pictures.</p>

<h3 class="title">Track Day Wrapup</h3>

<p>I got back from Texas World Speedway yesterday where I was participating in my first track day.  Basically put 30 bikes on a 3 mile twisty course with no speed limits.  It's really scary doing 125 down the straight for the first time and then it gets scarier when you realize there are people passing you at 150 10 feet away.  I'll post any pictures I can find but I forgot to bring my camera so I have none of my own.</p>

<h3 class="title">Under Construction...</h3>

<p>I'm revamping my home page.  It hasn't changed in several years so I'm using it as an excuse to catch up on some of the new Web technologies like CSS and Dynamic HTML that I don't know well.</p>

<p>Ok, updated more.  Looks like garbage in Internet Explorer but looks fabulous in Mozilla.  IE sucks.</p>

<p>Go to my home page to see the final version.  IE does not support the table, table-row, and table-cell display properties so I had to use old school table tags.  It's no wonder people still aren't using CSS very much...</p>

<h3 class="title">DB2 disappointment</h3>

<p>I promised DB2 numbers and spent all morning getting it running with our system only to find that it has some really <b>stupid</b> limitations: index and constraint names are limited to 18 characters.  This means that our system, which is packed with index names like IDX_QUESTION_QUESTIONID, will not work without significant reworking of our schema.  I cannot believe that a modern high-performance database like DB2 has this pathetic limitation.</p>

<p>So I gave up.  We will not be supporting DB2.  So far we have only gotten Oracle, MSSQL and postgresql to run without incident.</p>

<h3 class="title">Database Findings</h3>

<p>My chosen profession is that of the software architect.  I write large scale multi-tier systems that cost a lot of money.  An integral part of these systems is the database.  The relational database was invented in the early 70s with the first software examples appearing in the mid 80s or thereabouts.</p>

<p>As an architect, part of my job is providing as many choices as I can to the customer so they can tailor their installation of my software to suit their own needs/desires.  One of the big choices is that of the database - which database should I choose?  There are many choices:</p>

<p>Commercial:<br />
Oracle<br />
Sybase<br />
Microsoft SQL Server<br />
IBM DB2</p>

<p>Free:<br />
postgresql<br />
mysql<br />
sapdb</p>

<p>When it comes right down to it, those 7 choices cover 99% of all databases in the world.  Oracle is basically presumed to be the industry leader and having the fastest, most scalable offering.  But this was all rumor - until today.</p>

<p>We've been pushing for database independence at work so I've been investigating most of the major offerings to see if they are potential candidates for use with our software.  In doing so, I basically tried to get our unit test suite to run on each database.  The platform is Windows XP with a 2.5Ghz P4.  Here's the timing results of the test suite as run on each system:</p>

<p>Oracle - 3:00<br />
SQL Server - 3:45<br />
postgresql - 6:00<br />
sapdb - unable to run our app</p>

<p>The unit tests very much test the speed of the database out of the box.  I am not a DBA and none of the systems were tuned in any way.  SAPDB has some serious limitations in how much data you can return in a SELECT statement (8k!) which basically makes it useless for large J2EE applications.  BUT what I could get to run on SAPDB was blazingly fast.  With SAPDB, our cleandb procedure, which deletes the entire tablespace and rebuilds it from a set of SQL files, took 1/3 of the time it took on Oracle.  If you can live with its limitations, give it a try.</p>

<p>Overall I'm a little disappointed with postgresql.  It was stable and relatively easy to get working with our system but the performance is nowhere near the speed of the commercial guys.  I can't test Sybase because it only supports Windows NT right now (!).  I'm not even going to try mysql simply because our customers would laugh us out of the room if we told them we support it.  I'm going to try to get DB2 up and running tomorrow.</p>

<p>In closing, for the past 5 years I've always heard that Oracle was solid but not necessarily the fastest database.  Now I understand why they charge so much for it - it's solid, fast and flexible.</p>

<h3 class="title">Fowl Headgear</h3>

<p>For the last 24 hours, people around the world have been emailing me with one question on their mind: <em>What is a chicken hat?</em>  Well my friends, here is the answer to your common question:</p>

<h3 class="title">Wurst Day Ever!</h3>

<p>I surprised Becky by taking her to the <a href="http://www.wurstfest.com">Wurstfest</a> today to get our fill of German food, drink and music.  Needless to say I am full of good beer, nachos (hey, Germans don't make very good vegetarian food!) and just want to polka!</p>

<p>Of course the day would not be complete without the purchase of fowl headgear.  Yes, that's right, I am the proud owner of a chicken hat.</p>

<h3 class="title">Excuse me while I gripe...</h3>

<p>How does Windows Media Player suck?  Let me count the ways:</p>

<p><ul><br />
<li>The interface is completely nonstandard and difficult to use.<br />
<li>It's crippled by draconian copy protection default settings.<br />
<li>Makes performing simple tasks far too difficult.<br />
</ul></p>

<p>First off the interface is all flash and no substance.  It throws out years of windows standards for pretty widgets that impress for about 30 seconds and then grow tiring.  You can't use shortcut keys for the standard operations like play, forward, reverse, etc.  Try changing your system fonts - now the interface is horrible because it was designed to look good with the default system settings only.  Almost all common operations require the mouse to accomplish.</p>

<p>By default the program can only rip CDs to the Windows Media Audio format and copy protection is turned on.  This means if you copy your files to another machine, they will not play there!  If you reinstall your operating system, they will not even play on the same machine!  The first thing I did when I started WMP was enable MP3 ripping and turned off all copy protection.  It's <b>my</b> data that I paid $15 for - I'll decide where and how I want to listen to it!</p>

<p>Finally it makes simple tasks far too difficult.  I literally could not figure out how to burn an Audio CD.  You would think you would select "Create CD", pick the tracks you want to burn and hit Go.  Nope.  You can only burn tracks that are in your media library.  Obviously this is another copy protection scheme as you are no doubt limited as to which files you can add to your library and how many times you can burn them.  Once the files are imported, burning them to CD is relatively painless.</p>

<p>So my opinion is that WMP is a program designed to please the recording industry, not provide a solid, easy to use media program for the user.  I'm going to stick with Winamp.</p>

<h3 class="title">Another Horrifying Halloween</h3>

<p>Four of us sat out on my front lawn last night and handed out candy to the kids.  I was underwhelmed.  We had maybe 20 kids collect candy; I have a big bowl of candy left over.  Anyone want candy?</p>
