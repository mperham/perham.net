<p>The large trees in my front and back yards need trimming so I called up two local services and asked for estimates.  $1400 and $2400.  Ouch.</p>

<h3 class="title">More copyright nonsense</h3>

<p>Not only do corporations have basically an indefinite copyright on their works currently but now they want peer-to-peer file sharing to be considered an automatic felony (for even one file!) and people who share music and movies to get huge fines and possible jail times.  After all, murder and copyright infringement are basically the same.</p>

<p>I love how they term it a "author and consumer protection".  Call it what it is: "corporate protection".</p>

<p>http://www.wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,59654,00.html</p>

<p>An interesting sidenote found in a discussion on slashdot.org:</p>

<div style="background-color: #EEEEEE;">Someone need not have a law degree to understand that theft and copyright infringement have wholly different legal meanings.

<p>"Theft" is a crime. "Copyright infringement" is a civil offense. The people sponsoring this bill would like nothing more than to have the general public think of "copyright infringement" as "theft" -- because the average person is far more likely to believe that someone should go to jail for theft than for copyright infringement.</p>

<p>Theft and copyright infringement are different for a very important reason: In a theft, the victim is deprived of something that they previously had, whether it is money, jewelry, a car, or some other tangible thing. In copyright infringement, the victim has no less after the crime than before.</p>
