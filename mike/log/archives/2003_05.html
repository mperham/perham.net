<h3 class="title">Republic of Texas Rally</h3>

<p>The annual biker rally is this weekend here in Austin.  Thousands of (mostly) cruisers show up for the activities which include a parade downtown and motorcycle-oriented festivals.</p>

<p>But, like any group, you get the poseurs along with the real riders.  I saw a huge, brand new cruiser being trailered into town behind a huge SUV yesterday.  It's a bike - ride it!</p>

<h3 class="title">New Job</h3>

<p>Well, most of my close friends and family know but for those that don't, I recently switched jobs.  I spent the last 2.5 years working on the Carbon system and its various sibling systems at Question and Powered and was really getting burnt out as those companies went nowhere fast.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.webifyinc.com">Webify</a> is a chance to start fresh on a new problem space and further advance my knowledge.  I started as a Software Architect there two weeks ago.  Basically my job is to learn everything there is to know about <a href="http://www.serviceoriented.org/web_services.html">Web Services</a>, Grids, <a href="http://www.serviceoriented.org/process_orchestration.html">Process Orchestration</a> and other fancy sounding terms and distill them into something understandable and implementable by a team of engineers (which may also include myself).  Right now I am writing several papers including what is intended to be the main technical architecture document for the company in order to come up to speed on this industry.</p>
