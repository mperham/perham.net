<h3 class="title">holiday festivities</h3>

<p>Becky and I went to Southern California to spend xmas with my mom and dad.  We went to Palm Springs and Idyllwild one day and San Diego another.  I took home plenty of plunder, mostly home stuff and clothes.  Christmas presents just aren't as exciting as when you are a kid.  I did bring home an electronics kit I got as a present 15 years ago - I'd like to go through it again as my electronics knowledge is virtually nil.</p>

<p>I'm currently shopping for a new refrigerator.  Wheee, what fun.</p>

<p>Update: here's <a href="http://www.sears.com/sr/product/summary/productsummary.jsp?BV_SessionID=@@@@1882578508.1041219645@@@@&BV_EngineID=ccdfadchedhdihfcehgcemgdffmdflh.0&vertical=APPL&fromAuto=YES&bidsite=&pid=04685242000">the fridge</a> I bought.</p>

<h3 class="title">Tivo upgrade time!</h3>

<p>I bought a 120GB drive last night and started hacking my tivo.  First I copied the stock 40GB drive onto the new 120GB drive.  More difficult though was the process of getting network access.  Out of the box, the Hughes HDVR2 does not support Ethernet connectivity - you are forced to use a phone line and modem.  This is despite the fact that the platform it is based on, the Tivo Series 2, DOES support ethernet connections.  Apparently though you can hack the software to use ethernet - all the code is there, they just don't load the network drivers.  Anyhow I tried to load the drivers last night but had no luck.  I'm going to try again now and see if I can't get it right this time around.</p>

<p>EDIT: didn't work.  Argh!</p>

<h3 class="title">Laptop is sold</h3>

<p>Looks like I got a decent bidder this time and sold the laptop for $1750.  My fingers are crossed that all goes well.</p>

<h3 class="title">TiVo ROCKS!</h3>

<p>Woo Hoo!  Just got my new DirecTiVo from Circuit City yesterday.  It requires a phone line to set up so I had to take it to Becky's place to use her phone line but aside from that it is now up and running and recording shows as I type.  Now I need to find a cheap 120GB to upgrade it from 35 hours to 105 hours.</p>

<p>The 30 second skip is awesome.  Bon voyage commercials!</p>

<h3 class="title">eBay sucks</h3>

<p>I've been trying to <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&category=31542&item=2078980466&rd=1">sell my laptop</a> on ebay for the last 2 weeks because it's just too big and heavy for couch surfing.  In general my impression is that there are a lot of creeps and frauds out there.  These morons have several tricks up their sleeve:</p>

<p>1) Lowball you in hopes that you have no idea what your item is worth.  My laptop cost me $2500 4 months ago and would cost about $2100 new from Dell today.  I've had people offer me $850 (?!) and $1000 for it.  Gee thanks.</p>

<p>2) Ask your reserve price.  There's a reason why ebay doesn't show this to bidders!  Do you often walk into a store and ask the salesman "What's the store's cost on this item?"</p>

<p>3) Entice you to ship it to some Eastern European/Asian country with promises of a great price.  You'd be surprised how many US businessmen are travelling in Russia, want me to ship my laptop to them to replace their broken machine and will pay $1000 above my reserve as soon as they get it for my trouble.</p>

<p>If it doesn't sell tomorrow I'll probably just forget the whole thing and either sell it locally or live with the machine despite it's size and weight.</p>

<h3 class="title">Gobble Gobble!</h3>

<p>Becky and I had a great time spending Thanksgiving with various relatives on Thursday and Friday.  There's a new picture set available from my home page.  Check it out!  We also put up Christmas lights on the house yesterday.  After doing everything wrong that we possibly could, we finally got everything working correctly and I must say, I'm pretty happy with the results.  I'll post a picture of a house lit up at dusk later when I get the chance.</p>

<p>edit: here's the pic as promised.  Look closely - the lights are there!</p>
