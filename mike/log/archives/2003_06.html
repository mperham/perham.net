<h3 class="title">Car News</h3>

<p>I wondered why my car was pulling to the left pretty heavily.  A flat tire will do that.  In other news, Becky's roommate Kathy just bought a 2000 green Z3.  Way to go, Kathy!</p>

<h3 class="title">More Standards to Choose from</h3>

<p>More standards-based fun.  I joined <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org">OASIS</a> today for Webify.  I'm following the WSDM, WSRP and WS Security standards.</p>

<h3 class="title">Standards</h3>

<p>Most people agree that Web Services are the new, hot technology that everyone will be using 5 years from now.  The problem is, like all technologies, there needs to be standards so that service A can talk to service B.  There are tons of standards out there for all different aspects of web services but this can lead to even more problems when each standard has 3 versions published.  Vendor A supports SOAP 1.1, UDDI v2 and WSDL 1.0.  Vendor B supports SOAP 1.2, UDDI v3 and WSDL 1.0.  Even though they support the same standards, they can be incompatible with each other.</p>

<p>This is where the WS-I Basic Profile comes into play.  The Basic Profile is an attempt to create a "meta-standard" which codifies a set of standards, the exact versions supported and usage guidelines where specs collide.  Why am I telling you all this?  Because Webify joined the WS-I and I am Webify's representative on the Basic Profile working group.  The Basic Profile standard is probably THE most important standard for web services interoperability today and I'm very excited to be participating.  Read more at <a href="http://www.ws-i.org">http://www.ws-i.org</a>.  I will be working on other working groups in the future and attending conferences to further Webify's goal of being a leader, rather than a follower, in Web Services standards and technologies.</p>

<h3 class="title">Spam Busting successful!</h3>

<p>I have been using the internet for the past 10 years and during that time several of my email addresses have found their way onto the email lists of spammers.  I usually get about 30-40 spam emails per day and in an effort to rid myself of them automatically I installed SpamAssassin a year ago.  It always worked pretty well but recently I moved over to use my mail provider's custom SpamAssassin installation.  This move to a shared copy has made it work even better.  The absolute key to getting it to work well is to use blocklists so that mail from known spamming servers get tagged as such by adding this to your ~/.spamassassin/user_prefs</p>

<p>score RCVD_IN_RBL                         5.0<br />
score RCVD_IN_RSS                        5.0<br />
score RCVD_IN_DUL                        5.0<br />
score RCVD_IN_BL_SPAMCOP_NET   5.0<br />
score KOREAN_UCE_SUBJECT           5.0<br />
score RCVD_IN_UNCONFIRMED_DSBL 3.0<br />
score RCVD_IN_RFCI                         3.0</p>

<p>Now I get about 1 spam per day in my inbox, about 5 in a Not Sure folder and about 35 automatically deleted.  I've never actually seen a legitimate email in the Not Sure folder.</p>

<h3 class="title">Redneck</h3>

<p>Well, Bob Becky and I all went out on a boat on Lake Travis yesterday with Becky's roommate Kathy and a pair of her friends.  We swam around and caught some rays.  Unfortunately I caught too many on my chest and now I am burnt.  Ouch.</p>
