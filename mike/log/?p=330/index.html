				<p>Yesterday we went to a &#8220;resort&#8221; about 1.5 hours outside of Mumbai.  The difference between America and India is apparently everywhere you look.  The bus we took to the resort was smelly, beat up and the resort itself was basically two pools, a few large structures for sit down meals - nothing fancy at all (in fact pretty run down).  My point is that this is a reasonable place to hold a company picnic in India whereas in America, I&#8217;d start looking for a new job.</p>
<p>That said, I had a good time.  I left the hotel at 7am and we got there around 9:30.  We had breakfast and then played water volleyball and water polo in the pool for a few hours.  We had lunch and then played party games for prizes.  Most of the prizes were these candles made from gelatin in wine flutes.  I did not win anything throughout it all but at the end I was presented with a &#8220;special prize for Mr. Mike&#8221;.   You guessed it - a leftover gelatin candle.  It&#8217;s a beautiful candle so I was content.  In the end, I was exhausted from the long day and got back at the hotel at 8:30pm barely able to stay awake.</p>
<p>Some of the folks here are impressed with my natural affinity for Indian food.  I told them my diet in Austin was pretty pathetic (two words: tofu dogs) and so they are planning on sending me back home with a bunch of food that I can try out and possibly buy at Indian grocery stores in Austin.  Yum.</p>
<p>Today we are going to go shopping and see a little bit more of the downtown area.  Mumbai is a lot like Manhattan - a thin peninsula oriented North-South.  Well our office is located equivalent to a little north of midtown and we are going to head down to the equivalent of Wall St, to the tip of the island where the &#8220;money&#8221; lives and works.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been taking lots of pictures but the internet connection is not terribly fast so everything will have to wait until I get home.
