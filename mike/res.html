	<h1>Summary</h1>
	<p>
	I am a software developer, technical speaker and open source enthusiast.  For 8 years I
	focused on the design and development of object-oriented ecommerce and
	enterprise systems in Java.  The last 5 years focused on building 
	systems with open source tools, Ruby and Ruby on Rails.  I'm currently based in San Francisco
	but am looking to relocate to Portland.

	<p>My long-term focus at IBM (which acquired Webify in 8/06) is the design and implementation of service-oriented applications based on IBM's Business Services Fabric middleware.
