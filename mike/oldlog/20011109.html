So far the old new hardware is working fine.  I got some new new hardware: 
a Thrustmaster steering wheel for racing games and a Maxtor 60GB hard 
drive.  The steering wheel was flaky at first but there was a patch 
available on the Windows Update site that fixed it.  The new hard drive is 
also flaky.  It appears to crash XP on large DMA transfers.  I forced it 
down to PIO mode and it transfers without incident.  I'm going to try 
forcing it to ATA/33 instead of ATA/100 and see if the speed makes a 
difference.  It should be noted that it does not crash Linux so the problem
would seem to be XP's DMA support.
<P>
When working, the drive seems MUCH faster than the old drive.  XP boots in 20 
seconds flat whereas it was taking 30 seconds before.  
Kudos to Microsoft for their fast boot code.

I got my new hardware today.  Huzzah!  Took me about 30 minutes to rip out 
my old mainboard and install the new one.  Cool thing is that my old 
hardware is pushing 3 yrs old now and everything was reusable.  Power 
supply is only 250W but works fine.  Case had all the punchouts required 
for all the built-in connectors.  Gotta love standards.
<P>
The new system is about 3 times faster than my old system.  I had to tweak 
the RAM settings to get optimal performance but that wasn't too difficult.
<P>
<a href="http://www.hmonitor.com">hmonitor</a> is a great tool that you 
can use to monitor the temperature of your CPU/mainboard.  It also has 
this cool feature where it will slow down the processor when it is not 
being used.  I assume this is a low-priority thread that simply issues the 
HLT command.  Either way - the average temperature of my CPU has dropped 
15 degrees celcius because of it!  Highly recommended - I wish Linux and 
XP supported this out of the box.
<P>
I had to reinstall XP because of the mainboard/processor change.  What a 
pain.  Linux worked without incident save for the fact that the 
VIA AC97 sound chip needs a newer kernel for support.  Gotta love open 
source.

Becky and I had a picnic lunch on the lawn in front of the Capital today.
She makes a mean hummus, avacado and tomato sandwich.  We also went to
Rath's house in the evening to hand out candy to all the kids.

Hacked the external callout into the POP3 code for Mozilla.  I couldn't figure out the PREFS api
in Mozilla so I could store the command string in prefs.js.  I submitted the diff as is and
hopefully the Mozilla guys will put it into the main source soon.  It takes my machine several
hours to build Mozilla - I _really_ need to upgrade my machine (450 Celeron).  I'll probably get
an AMD 1700+ with 512MB DDR.
<P>
<b>Update:</b> just ordered a 1700+, Shuttle AV31A MB and 512MB of RAM for $350.  Whoo-hoo!

<h3>10/27/2001</h3>
Wow, I had a great time with Becky at the party last night.  Tons of people
there and plenty of booze to inbibe.
<P>
Planning on working on my motorcycle (it has an intermittent starter
problem that is probably just a bad contact) and looking at Mozilla.  I
submitted bug <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=100683">
100683</a> to run an external program before downloading POP3
mail and I want to take a stab at doing it myself.  That's what open source
is all about...

<h3>10/26/2001</h3>
Lunch with <a href="http://www.middleware-company.com">edro</a> and then
off to Busey's to play with Linux and XP.  I'm really opposed to Microsoft
based on their continuing anti-competitive business practices.  I use Linux
99% of the time already and the other 1% is for gaming - which Windows 2000
does ok for now.  I think $99 is a very reasonable cost given the quality
of the XP release.  But then again, the first hit of crack is always free,
right?
<P>
Becky and I are off to a Halloween party tonight with friends of hers.
<P>
Anybody have a <a href="http://www.svrider.com">Suzuki SV650S</a> they want
to sell me?  I really need a bigger bike than my <a
href="http://www.kawasaki.com/motorcycles/2002/flash/ninja500r/ninja500r.htm">Ninja 500</a>.
I test rode an SVS the other day and it was sweet.  ALOT more power than the
500.

I read just a few days ago that computers are responsible for 13% of all
power usage in the US.  I don't know this for a fact but I do know that
wherever I go, computers often are left on 24 hrs a day.
<P>
I think this is irresponsible.
<P>
Not of the users but of the OS and hardware manufacturers that they don't
do more to make power saving work straight out of the box.  It would be
trivial for Dell to turn on monitor powerdown after 15 minutes for all the
computers it sells.  It would be trivial for Microsoft to make it default
for Windows.  Imagine the power savings.
<P>
I've setup Linux so I can put it in Standby mode.  This works out of the
box with Redhat 7.2.  Just use <code>apm -s</code>.  This will not power
down your drives; to do that, just use the <code>/sbin/hdparm</code>
command to set the powerdown timeout to something reasonable.  I have an 'off' script that does all that for me (including 'sync' in case
the power goes out while the machine is in standby).

<h3>10/24/2001</h3>
I've decided to try out the whole weblog thing.  It might be interesting to
look back at what I did in months past...
<P>
Spent a few hours installing Redhat 7.2.  I learned long ago to put the
/home directories on a separate disk so OS upgrades do not destroy user
data.  This made the upgrade really easy... sort of.  Unfortunately XFree86
4.1.0 does not like my GF2MX -> DVI -> 18" LCD video setup.  It couldn't
display anything at any resolution and the log file indicated nothing
wrong.  I grabbed nvidia's driver with lynx, installed it and everything is
peachy.
<P>
Given my current unemployed status, I've been sort of bored and looking for
an interesting project a la my jnap project 2 years ago.  I heard about
<a href="http://www.jxta.org">jxta</a> a few months ago and am considering
writing a generic file sharing program.  Kinda old hat at this point -
we'll see.
<P>
I've gotten into Ed McBain's 87th Precinct novels recently.  Pretty good
murder mysteries if you want a quick read.
