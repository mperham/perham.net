Bought my new bike on Thursday and picked it up on Saturday.  Jarod and I
went cruising that afternoon and put 100 miles on it.  It is a beautiful
bike but definitely NOT made for long distance touring.  I'm 6' tall and my
knees hurt after about 20 minutes of riding.  This is definitely a commuter
bike.  I plan on doing a few cosmetic things to it to make it look real
sharp; I want to add xenon headlamps (they are actually safer because of
drivers will notice you more often), install flush turn signals and
elimenate the hideous rear fender on the bike.  I have no plans to touch
anything mechanically on the bike.  Oh, and I'm also considering adding sliders to protect the body if it ever falls over.
<P>
I tried out some active, powered antennaes for my TV in a valiant effort to
see the Olympics.  Folks, powered antennaes are the most worthless pieces
of junk - don't bother.  I literally get a better picture from my $10
passive radio shack deal than I did from two different $50 active antennaes.

Sold my 1999 Ninja 500R last night for $2500.  It was a piece of crap - good
riddance.  If anyone is thinking about buying one, don't.  The Suzuki GS500
or SV650 are much better bikes.  This from a service manager of a
local motorcycle place with decades of experience...  That made me feel
better since I am planning on buying a SV650S real soon now.
<P>
Looks like I'll be getting and accepting a job offer with <a
href="http://www.powered.com">powered</a> today.  I need the medical
insurance to resume my bike riding.

I recently cancelled my cable.  Time Warner upped their rates such that 
standard cable now costs more than directv.  Instead I'm now using an 
antenna and saving $45/month.  95% of my TV watching is FOX and NBC 
anyhow.  Good riddance.
<P>
I went into my apt complex office yesterday and asked them to give me a 
rate cut since I am about to sign a lease and the apt market sucks right 
now (vacancy rate is very high right now so it's a renter's market right 
now).  They called me today and said they'd give me $100 off next month's 
rent.  Hey, I was going to sign anyhow so I'll take free money!  :-)  
Moral of the story: it never hurts to ask.

Hooked up <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/">lucene</a> as the
new keyword search engine inside <a
href="../resume.html">marketgravity</a>. Previously we were using <a
href="http://www.oracle.com/intermedia/">intermedia</a> and I hated it.  
It tied us to Oracle and required alot of Oracle-specific skills that the
dev team (being all java developers) didn't have.  Lucene is a pure-Java
file-based search engine and seems to be much faster.  It only took me 1.5
days to hook up and the API is relatively simple.

I've been investigating secure file transfer mechanisms since ftp is 
simply too insecure.  There's several different programs, most of which 
seem to use ssh or a version thereof for the underlying transport.  The 
contenders include: sftp, scp and ssft.  There are several flavors of the 
first two while the later is written by the same fellow who wrote WarFTPd.
<P>
I grabbed <a href="http://www.openssh.org">openssh</a> and compiled it for
Win32 with the cygwin package.  Worked out of the box without a problem -
as long as you are comfortable with compilers and Unix.  :-)  This package
has sftp and scp include in its suite of secure tools.  You run the ssh
server on one box and then can use any of the secure tools to login or
xfer files.  Works pretty well.
<P>
The problem with it is that sftp is slow.  REALLY slow.  Miserably slow.  
So I tested scp.  It's actually much faster.  5-10x faster.  What is so 
perplexing is that my tests were simply "transfer this large file from one 
machine to another".  You'd think that that would use the same or similar 
code.  Very odd.  Another result of my testing is that the <a 
href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a> secure 
tools suite is the fastest of the bunch.  Highly recommended.

Bye to Raj.  Best of luck in Atlanta, buddy.
<P>
Got a DVD player for Xmas.  Actually I got a gift certificate to Fry's and 
with it bought a demo Panasonic DVD-RP56.  Supposedly a good value for the 
money although the MP3 player leaves something to be desired.  I wish it 
had a shuffle mode.  The problem with getting a DVD player is now I need 
to upgrade the other components in my system.  I have a crappy TV so now I 
need to buy a $2000 TV.  Argh!  What I really need is a super remote.  I 
have 5 remotes now and really need something that handles macros.  I'm 
considering the Pronto 2000 but it costs as much as the DVD player!  Only 
one conclusion can be drawn from my situation: home theatre is expensive.

It's been a while since I rapped at ya.  I'm doing contract work for 
Powered - they are buying the marketGravity system that I was the main 
architect for so I am helping them morph the code into something they can 
use.
<p>
Right now I'm working on revamping our tree control applet.  marketGravity 
has a web-based UI built on Struts and JSP technology.  Well, we needed 
something that could show hierarchical data for selection (like the 
left-hand tree in Windows Explorer) and there isn't anything out of the 
box in the HTML world like that.  Since I'm a java developer and I was the 
one solving the problem, I decided to go with a java 1.1 applet that 
displays data given to it from the server.  Every browser worth 
considering supports java 1.1 applets so compatibility is a non-issue.  
Anyhow, long story short, the tree applet worked OK as designed.
<p>
But it had this one annoying property - if you reloaded the page, the 
hierarchy would reset itself and the user would have to open the folders 
again.  Now it doesn't.  :-)  I rewrote it to speak XML (previously it 
used a proprietary flat file format) and wrote a whole server-side caching 
scheme whereby the server tracks what the user clicks and can reload that 
state the next time the applet reinitializes.  Big shout-out to John 
Wilson, whose micro-sized XML parser, MinML2, is used by the tree.
<p>
Today.  Wow, what a productive day.  I started today with a million
errands to run.  I got up at 6AM and went straight to work, put it my 8
hours (wrote all of the server-side state caching and started debugging).  
I then drove to Frys because my desktop's power supply blew up last night 
- sparks and all!  Bought a new case/PS and moved all my hardware over to 
the new case.  Cleaned out the fish tank, applied for a motorcycle chassis 
repair course at ACC, burnt a CD for Becky's birthday and paid all my 
bills.  Whew.
