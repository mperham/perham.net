I saw Spider-Man today.  A very well done movie.  Highly recommended.

I won <a href="http://www.mmw.net">Medeski, Martin and Wood</a> passes from
<a href="http://www.kvrx.org">KVRX</a> for the show at Stubb's next
weekend.  All I had to do was call in and chat with the DJ on the air for a
minute.  What I love about KVRX (aside from playing good music) is the fact
that because its a college station NO ONE listens to them in the early
morning except for me.  :-)  Makes it real easy to win stuff.

Later...  Wow, I just left my apt complex on my bike to ride to the local
book store.  I was going over a small hill when I realized the entire road
was covered in gravel.  My tires did a little dance, my rear brake locked
the tire but luckily I kept the bike upright.  No sign or warning at all.
Turns out they are repaving the road around my complex but I never saw any
signs until I was in the rough stuff...

<a href="../nudecat/">This</a> is one sorry lookin' cat.  Also note that
the last two sets of pictures where generated with my own custom java page
generator (mentioned below).

Pictures from the weekend are <a href="../parents">here</a>.

My parents came down to Austin for the weekend to see me.  They met Becky
and we all spent some time together around town.  One positive thing that
came out of this weekend is my next free software project.  I haven't done
anything since <a href="../jnap">jnap</a> and its about time to change
that.  Yesterday afternoon I was trying to take some pictures from my
camera and put them up here.  Unfortunately it would seem that all good web
generation software costs money.  One example is <a
href="http://www.photodex.com">Compupic</a> - a cool program that allows
you to do all sorts of things to your images and than create web page
thumbnail galleries.  But it costs money and I figure my needs are simple
enough that I can write a Java program that will do 95% of what I want
pretty quickly.
<P>
Thus is born <strong>Genny</strong>, the web thumbnail page generator.

Changed the fork oil in my bike from 5W to 15W.  This is supposed to really
improve the suspension of the bike - since it is a heavier oil, the bike
will dive less under heavy braking and jolts will be dampened better.
Makes sense and the bike definitely did not dive as much when braking
heavily.

Jarod and I worked on my bike all weekend.  We put on frame sliders, flush
turn signals and a fender eliminator kit.  Check out the before and after
pictures of the fender eliminator:

Here's a picture of the new turn signals and the frame sliders (it's the
black tube sticking out of the bike).

Replaced the normal headlights in my motorcycle with blue xenon bulbs.
They make the old lights look almost orange/yellow in comparision.  It only
took 20 minutes once I realized that the owners manual told me what I
needed to do.  :-)  Note the cat eye is the original bulb - see how orange
it is in comparision?

I spent the last two days at work pulling out all <a
href="http://www.bea.com/products/weblogic/server/index.shtml">Weblogic</a>
specific code from Defender (nee marketGravity) so that we can run it on
any J2EE 1.3 compliant servlet engine.  I tried for a day to get <a
href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Tomcat</a>
4.0.2 to work but found it to be very buggy.  It had fundamental bugs in
handling basic things like relative paths with the &lt;jsp:include&gt; tag.
I gave up this morning and one of the other developers mentioned that they
used <a href="http://www.caucho.com">Resin</a> in the previous version of
Powered's product line.  Well, I downloaded it and had it working with
Defender in something like 3 hours without a single problem.
<P>
This means that we can get rid of Weblogic which, although the industry
leader, is very heavyweight and offers far more features (at a high cost)
than we need.  Good riddance.
<P>
Kudos to Caucho for what appears to be a great servlet container at a very
low price.
