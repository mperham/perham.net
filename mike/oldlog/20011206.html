<h3>12/6/2001</h3>
My african journal is now up.  It took me about 2 hours to write and made 
me realize how hard it is to write well.  Sheesh.  I'm going to stick to 
code.
<P>
I finished making my top secret Christmas presents for the guys.  I just 
need to box them up and deliver them now.

<h3>12/4/2001</h3>
I've put up the images from my cruise last month and the africa trip last
week.  I'll be writing up my thoughts from the trip soon.

<h3>11/18/2001</h3>
I played Halo on the new Xbox today.  Yawn.  I'd like to see Project Gotham
Racing and SSX Tricky though.  Both look cool.

<h3>11/16/2001</h3>
A slow Friday.  Unemployment starts to drag after a few weeks.  I've been
reading a ton - all the 87th Precinct novels by Ed McBain and anything by
Dan Simmons that I haven't read already.  If you have never read anything
by Dan Simmons, drop what you are doing right now and buy something by him.
He's a great author and almost everything he writes is superb (I think the third
and fourth books in the Hyperion series are the exception).  The
high-powered sports cars he puts in many of his later novels are merely
icing on the cake.  How about a sports bike in the next one, Danny boy?
:-)
