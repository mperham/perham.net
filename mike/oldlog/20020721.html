Well the recovery process has been long and agonizing.  I have to say: if you
have choice as to whether you break your collar bone or not, DON'T!  I'm feeling
a
lot better than I was on Mon/Tues but I still feel crippled due to this
harness I have to wear 24 hrs a day.  At least sleeping is not a problem
anymore.
<p/>
I bought Dntel's <em>Life is Full of Possibilities</em> based on a
recommendation on slashdot about good electronic music.  The guy seemed to
think it was the best album of the year; I found it to be ok but nothing
to write home about.  It certainly did not impress me nearly as much as
Boards of Canada, Squarepusher, Aphex Twin, u-Ziq or other such bands.
<p/>
I went out house hunting with a realtor today and found a fabulous house.
I'll be following up on it shortly.

I went out riding today and crashed my motorcycle.  I was wearing all my
gear so I just broke my collarbone.  I was probably doing about 40 around a
tight turn when it happened though so it could have been much worse.
Here's a <a href="/mike/images/bone.jpg">picture</a> of me before the
accident.

Bought a new laptop today from Dell.  I won't go into all the details
but it has all the bells and whistles.  I also met with a real estate agent
today so the house buying process is slowly moving along.

Some more news on the motorcycle front.  I installed the Scorpion can a few
days ago and it sounds alot better.  I don't feel anymore power than stock
so I'll have to check to make sure there are no leaks in the system and
everything is installed tightly.
<p/>
I also took the MSF Experienced Rider course Saturday but was not terribly
impressed with it.  Basically it was a faster paced version of the beginner
course.  I'd rather have practiced the exercises on my own at my own pace.
<p/>
I just wish it would STOP RAINING in Austin.  It's poured cats and dogs for
the past 3 days - the middle of summer!

I am so smart, S-M-R-T!  Solved my Unix TERM issues.  If you don't
understand what this means, trust me, you DON'T WANT to understand what it
means.
<p/>
I also installed <a href="http://www.spamassassin.org">SpamAssassin</a> to replace my home-grown procmail spam
filtering recipes.  It looks pretty good so far although it has marked 1-2
legit emails so far as spam.  It looks like its better than my own recipes
though so overall it's a good thing.

Bought a new can for the bike yesterday.  I ordered a stainless steel
<a
href="http://www.scorpionexhausts.com/bikehtml/datasearch/products.php?makeid=SUZUKI&model_id=SI+65+-+SV650+%2F+SV650S+1999+ON&submit=continue">Scorpion</a> exhaust.  Theoretically it does not require rejetting or repacking
ever so it requires no maintainence.  Excellent.

Got bored yesterday and decided to add a little flair to my <a href="..">homepage</a>.  The
image is now dynamic and rotates randomly between about 5-6 different
pictures.  It's done in PHP which I've never programmed before but I found
some sample source on the web which did what I wanted so it was pretty easy
to get running.
<h3>06/09/2002</h3>
Ok, so I started reading <em>Timemaster</em> by Robert Forward.  This is
such a <b>bad</b> book it's not even funny.  Please do yourself a favor and
burn any copies you see.  I usually don't go too harsh on a book I don't
like as everyone has different tastes; if I don't like something I'll tell
people to try it for themselves and see what they think.  But this book is
simply so poorly written (yet positively reviewed on Amazon of course!)
that I don't think people should even bother trying for themselves.  Trust
me, this one stinks.  The sad thing is that Arthur C. Clarke gives it a
glowing blurb on the dust jacket.  There goes any trust I had in his
opinion.  Read the <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0812516443/ref=pd_pym_rvi_1/002-6283585-5258449">Kirkus
review</a> to get a better take on what I mean.  The key word is hogwash.
<h3>06/08/2002</h3>
I'm now reading Stephen Wolfram's <a
href="http://www.wolframscience.com/">A New Kind of Science</a> and it's a
controversial book.  He really does have some interesting ideas on complexity but
I'm bothered by his flip attitude toward academia and publishing.  He seems
to completely ignore rigor and proof in his science.  Pictures and millions
of iterations of a computer experiment seem to be enough to prove something
true to him while this is completely anathema to modern science.  Freeman
Dyson, the world famous physicist from Princeton, has called this book
"worthless"; I'd guess for this very reason.  At any rate, the book is
worth it just for the pretty pictures.  :-)
<p/>
I rode Lime Creek for the first time early this morning.  It's an exciting
twisty road but had alot of gravel.  I almost lost it on a decreasing
radius turn that went steeply downhill at the same time.  I think I was
only doing 25 or so but even that felt too fast for me.  No doubt my bike
could do it at 30 but I'm such a new rider that I can't take advantage
of that.  There was a guy racing his Ferrari 348 GTS on the same road;
needless to say he left me in his dust.
<h3>06/07/2002</h3>
I finished <em>Slant</em> by Bear yesterday.  Very interesting book.  I
think it's his take on the Gibson/Stephenson cyberpunk novels.  I don't
know whether I liked it or not.  I guess you'll have to read it and decide
for yourself.
<p/>
I signed up for the <a href="http://www.msf-usa.org">MSF</a> <a
href="http://www.aplusrider.com/Advanced/advanced.htm">Advanced</a> motorcycle safety course
later this month.  While riding to the Biker's night two days ago, Jarod
went down on his Yahama V-Star and while he was uninjured, it made me
realize that I could use an emergency handling training course.
<p/>
I've found my next motorcycle.  It's a 2-cylinder work of art called the <a
href="http://www.ducati.com/bikes/my2002/ducatiModel.jhtml?modelName=748S">Ducati 748S</a>.  Only $14,000 MSRP.  Anyone need a kidney?

<em>Moving Mars</em> (again, by Bear) is an amazing book.  Some people on
<a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0812524802/gregbearcom/104-9965455-7321513">Amazon</a>
don't like it but I was totally immersed.  It deserves a sequel or three.
<h3>05/20/2002</h3>
<em>Anvil of Stars</em> by Greg Bear is really good.  So far I like it better
than <em>Forge of God</em>.
<h3>05/17/2002</h3>
I've been playing this fun little game called <a
href="http://www.jagex.com/fleas.html">Flea Circus</a> which is basically a
rip off of Lemmings.  The game is locked up tight so it is practically
impossible to get the passwords from the datafile.  The code is obfuscated
and the datafile is encrypted.  Here's some passwords I've gotten by
finishing levels:
<p/>
itch, yoyo, winter, splendid, galaxy, penguin, plate, eagle and many more!
<p/>
Good luck fleaing!

Star Wars II is mediocre.  You heard it here first.
<h3>05/12/2002</h3>
Went to the Lake today with a bunch of friends.  We rented a pontoon boat
and stayed out drinking beer and swimming for a few hours.  I'm not quite
red as a lobster but my nose is doing a fair imitation of Rudolph's.  The
whole occasion was in honor of my friend Will who is leaving Austin to
attend business school at Wharton for the next 2 years.  Good luck buddy.
<p/>
Yesterday Becky and I went house hunting, swam at Barton Springs, attended
the <a href="http://www.texasgreekfestival.com">Texas Greek Festival</a>
and closed the evening by attending the Medeski Martin and Wood concert I
mentioned in an earlier log entry.
<p/>
I'm almost finished with <em>Tangents</em> by Greg Bear.  It's a pretty
good collection of short stories.  Recommended.
<p/>
Happy Mother's Day, mom!!!
<h3>05/07/2002</h3>
I've been reading alot of books by <a href="http://www.gregbear.com">Greg Bear</a> lately.  He's a pretty good
sci-fi author; so far I've read about 4-5 books of his ranging from
excellent to mediocre.  So far I've liked <em>Eon</em> best but
<em>Darwin's Radio</em> was also quite good.  <em>The Forge of God</em> was
pretty good (cool premise, mediocre execution) but I couldn't get more than
20 pages into <em>Eternity</em> (a shame considering it's the followup to
<em>Eon</em>).
<p/>
Anyhow I plan to read a few more of his books soon - I'll put up further
reviews at that time.
