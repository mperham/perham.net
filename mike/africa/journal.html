<h2>My African Experience</h2>

<h3>Day One</h3>

The flight was LONG.  It was a 2.5 hour trip to Atlanta followed by a 15
hour flight to Johannesburg.  I wish I had $5000 to spend on a first class
ticket.  We spent an hour getting a Land Rover for the next few days.
We're five big guys with plenty of luggage and a long drive to the bush so
we need something big.  It cost $100/day which, all things considered,
isn't too bad.
<p>
We got to Terry's folks place - it is great.  A beautiful house with a
spectacular view of Johannesburg and surrounding environs.  Jo'burg strikes
you as a surreal place.  The crime is unbelievable; there is security and
walls everywhere.  I wondered why anyone would live in a place like this
until I found out that 25% of the revenue stream for the entire African
continent is produced in Jo'burg.  It all comes down to Money.

<h3>Day Two (Images 437 - 460)</h3>

We leave Jo'burg at 6 AM with a 6 hour drive to get to the game farm.  We
stop in several small towns for breakfast and store browsing.  The last
50km of the road is unpaved and Land Rover handles it beautifully.  We
arrive at the Simbambili game farm around 1:30 PM - the place is stunning.
We are staying in the Owner's Lodge since Terry's family is a partial owner
of the farm.  I found out that Simbambili's prices are approx R2500/night
per person + tips and food.  This is about $250 at the current exchange
rate.  Our stay is free except for the tips.  Excellent.
<p>
Our first game drive is at 4:30 PM.  We get in this huge Land Rover
Defender (hereafter called "the truck") without a top or windshield but
with ampitheatre-style seats along with our tracker, James, and our driver,
Koetzer (pronounced Koot-sir).  The tracker sits in a seat in front of the
truck and just scans the area for wildlife.  The driver, aside from his
obvious role, fills us with anecdotes and facts about the different
animals.  Their goal is to spot as many of the "big five" as possible over
the next 3 days.  The big five are the five most dangerous animals in
Africa to hunt and consist of buffalo, elephant, leopard, lion and rhino.
Soon we spot a waterbok, with his striped butt, and a bachelor herd of
buffalo.  One down.  Awhile later a message comes over the radio that a
goup of lions has been spotted a mile or so from us and we speed off to
find them.  It is a family group with a mom, 3 cubs and a male friend (not
the father).  That's two.  It is amazing how close we get to them without
them even caring.  Apparently they percieve the truck to be harmless since
it has never harmed them and does not smell like meat or danger.  After 20
minutes or so, we start up and head off to find a deserted area for tea as
the sun sets.
<p>
After tea it is dark and we start the night portion of the drive.  The
tracker shines a bright light all around in front of the truck very quickly
looking for flashes from the retinas of nocturnal animals.  Because of the
construction of their eyes, nocturnal animals are not bothered by bright
lights being shined in their faces and so we can see them fairly easily
without undue stress.  Unfortunately this is not true of day animals.  I
used a flash on an elephant and it didn't like it at all.  It bellowed but
did not charge us - a close call for both us and the elephant as the driver
carries a .458 rifle that will stop basically anything that moves.  The
drive finishes around 8 and we head back to the lodge for dinner and bed
since we need to be up at 5:00 AM for the morning game drive.  Aside from
the elephant, we saw nothing of note.  A very quiet night drive.
<p>
A footnote about insects: they are everywhere and in great quantities.  We
are mainly worried about malaria spread by mosquito since there is no
vaccine or cure.  Mosquito repellant is used very liberally during the
evening as this is when they are really active.  During the three days I
don't believe I was bitten once.  Huzzah!  The mosquito nets over the beds
seem odd at first but you realize how useful they are once the number of
bugs becomes apparent.

<h3>Day Three (Images 462 - 487)</h3>

Game drive starts around 5:30 or 6 AM and goes until about 10.  We spot a
herd of antelope (what kind?).  That's it.  None of the big five are
spotted.  We are disappointed.
<p>
During the day, we basically kill time chatting, napping, eating or playing
games.  Chess becomes popular after ChrisP delivers a spanking to me and
becomes the reigning champion.  Tomorrow he will beat Terry and Will also.
We also played Hearts with Andrew being pretty good at it.  I don't seem to
be very good at games - maybe I'll give up playing them.  :-)
<p>
After a less than spectacular morning we hope the evening fairs better.
Almost immediately we spot a giraffe.  Giraffes are big and tall.  This
should not be understated.  Really big.  We also find a dung beetle.  Dung
Beetles may not be cute or fuzzy but they are kinda cool in their own way.
They collect dung into big balls and roll them to their underground lairs.
You have to laugh when you see them in action - they roll the ball then
climb on it to get a visual bearing on where to go.  Roll for another 6
inches, get bearing, repeat...  Another radio report informs us of a nearby
leopard.  Leopards are the hardest of the big five to find - it is quite
common to not find one at all during a weekend of drives.  The leopard is
spectacular - they hide extremely well and the way they move is just so
fluid.  There is much rejoicing amongst the troops and so we break for tea.
After tea we head back to the leopard to check him out at night.  They're
nocturnal so light is not a problem.  After cruising around for an hour or
so, the radio informs us of lions in the vicinity.  It's the same group as
the previous night  but this time on the move.  Break for dinner and bed.

<h3>Day Four (Images 488 - 526)</h3>

We decide to start the morning drive even earlier in the hopes that more
animals are up and about.  We start at 5 AM.  Impala, Kudu and other
antelopes are abundant.  We spot a warthog - wow they are cool.  A radio
report comes in about a leopard.  We speed over to check him out.  We do so
and soon another report comes in about a nearby rhino.  As this is the last
of the big five, we speed off to the location.  The rhino is in a
relatively inaccessible location so we drive through bush, over trees and
just generally ignore common sense in order to get a good look at the
rhino.  He obliges for about a minute or two before wandering off.  We get
stuck.  To unstick ourselves, it is necessary to use a jack and wooden
board to gain traction in the mud.  After 5 minutes of work we are free and
putting fear into the hearts of all the vegetation between us and the
trail.  End of morning drive.
<p>
Koetzer and James volunteer to take us on a game hike around the some of the
nearby trails to get a closer look at the land and vegetation.  They warn
us about wandering into deep grass since it may contain disease-carrying
ticks.  I begin to realize that there is very little in the bush that does
not kill you.  Our two guides lead us around and show us various trees,
flowers, insects, etc.  I focus on staying as far from grass as possible.
<p>
The evening game drive is one for the record books.  We first spot zebras.
Zebras are cool.  They look like clown horses.  Ya gotta love em.  Then we
spot giraffes.  You already know my feelings on giraffes.  Next is a cute
little baby kudu.  Finally we track down an elephant.  We spotted all big
five during the day over the course of the past 3 days and have the
pictures to prove it.
<p>
That evening we have a big meal outside with Tiki torches along with 
after-dinner scotch and cuban cigars.  All in all, an excellent 3 days 
that I will never forget.

<h3>Day Five (Images 528 - 570)</h3>

We get up at 3:45 AM to get the gate out of the game park at 5 AM.  The
gate only operates from 5 AM to 11 PM and they make no exceptions.  We got
there at 4:45 and were off to Jo'burg at 5 AM.  The drive took about 5.5
hours.  Terry almost killed us when he took a sharp turn way too fast right
before the airport; the Land Rover squealed horribly but stayed upright.
We dropped off the car and flew off to Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe.
<p>
You have to pay hard currency to get into and out of Zimbabwe.  This is the
first sign that things work very differently here.  $20USD to enter and
$20USD to exit.  Our taxi driver informs us that the "official" exchange
rate is 55 Zim dollars to 1 US dollar.  The blackmarket rate (i.e. the rate
everyone else uses) is 170 to 1.  He takes us to a change place where we
all exchange USD for ZIMD.  I change $60US and get $10200ZIM.  A bottle of
water is $120.  This is a pretty good deal.
<p>
We are staying at a relatively new hotel near the falls.  This hotel is
modern and has all the appeal of a Las Vegas hotel.  It is garish, touristy
and expensive.  It is also mostly empty; the recent political events in
Zimbabwe have slowed tourism.  We unpack and head off to see what we came
for: Victoria Falls.
<p>
The falls are very impressive.  Much cooler than Niagra.  What else can I
say; stop reading this and check out the pictures.
<p>
We finish the night with a buffet dinner and a little blackjack in the
casino ($200 minumum bet - another good deal!).  I win $1500 and think I am
really cool until I realize that that is $9USD.

<h3>Day Six (Images 572 - 575)</h3>

Four of us (minus Andrew) decide to go whitewater rafting on the Zambezi
River.  This turns out to be one of the most dangerous and exhilirating
things I have ever done.  The descent down the cliff to the rafts on the
river was the most dangerous thing I have ever done.  It was extremely
steep with a minimum of construction to guard our descent.  I could easily
see someone slipping and getting killed in the fall.
<p>
There were several injuries over the course of the rafting.  I slipped on
the descent down and beat up my left leg pretty badly.  It is now 9 days
after the rafting and I still have a huge blotch of hematoma near my foot.  
Terry and another member of our boat, Michael, both hurt their ankles in
the foot braces on the raft.  Of course once they complained of the pain
our guide told us not to put our foot in the braces.  Thanks for the
forewarning...
<p>
The actual rafting itself was absolutely amazing.  I consider it the finest
adventure during this trip and quite possibly my life.  The Zambezi is
considered a class 5 river, where rapids are graded from class 1 (trivial)
to class 5 (most dangerous commercially raftable), which means that it
contains at least one class 5 rapid.  In fact, most of its rapids are from
class 4 to 5 and all are a blast.  I fell out of the boat several times and
never felt in danger.  The grip line around the boat along with my lifevest
provided plenty of security.
<p>
Getting back up the riverside cliffs proved to be almost as hellish as the
descent.  This time the pathway was essentially safe - just extremely
arduous.  I was exhausted by the time I was only half way up.  I eventually
reached the top after 20 - 30 minutes of climbing and we were driven back
to town in a truck.
<p>
We changed and headed off for a sunset booze cruise upriver from the Falls.
Nothing really to speak off except for the beautiful sunset and the sight
of a hippo's nostils.  It was a welcome respite after the day's activities.

<h3>Day Seven (Image 576)</h3>

I woke up in misery.  My legs were so sore I was barely able to walk.
Walking would be a problem for the rest of the trip for me.
We packed up, bought some pictures of the rafting and shopped in the local
marketplace for curios that morning.  I had brought a pair of jeans and a
sweatshirt for trading purposes and I was surprised at how well this was
received.  The guys went nuts once they saw them.  Shoes also seemed big -
I was propositioned several times to trade for my sneakers.  Too bad I
didn't have any other shoes.  I spent every dime I had along with the
clothes at the marketplace and picked up some sculptures and a chess set.
I had spent my last $20 at the marketplace when I realized that I needed it
to get out of the country.  I asked around and everyone else told me they
had spent all their money except for the last $20 they needed to get out!
I was starting to worry and wondering if they would take my watch in
lieu...  I got back to the hotel and found Terry waiting with a $20 bill
for me.  "Put this in your pocket and don't lose it." he told me.  I
forgave him for almost killing me three days before.  We flew back to
Jo'burg and caught a flight to Cape Town.  Terry's sister and her boyfriend
were waiting for us and helped us with the luggage back to the Angelos
vacation home.  The place was amazing.  It is really high up and has an
awesome view of the ocean and the town below.  We went out to dinner with
them and a cousin.

<h3>Day Eight (Images 578 - 599)</h3>

The next morning we headed up to Table Mountain.  Table Mountain is a mesa
overlooking all of Cape Town and the surrounding area.  The view was clear
and spectacular.  We then toured the wine country near Cape Town.  There
are several world-class wineries within 30 minutes of Cape Town.  I don't
really like wine and was pleasantly surprised when I found their wines to
be quite palatable.  I also met a large pig.  For dinner we went to a
restaurant named the Green Dolphin.  It is a restaurant on the waterfront
devoted to live jazz.  Needless to say I was in heaven.  The jazz was
superb and the food just as good.  Afterwards we went to a local club
called The Fez.  We felt it was our destiny to go there due to our fondness
for a local Austin bar called The Red Fez.  Andrew and I went home early
(1AM) while Terry, Will and ChrisP stayed out late.

<h3>Day Nine (Images 600 - 610)</h3>

We spent much of the morning at the waterfront shopping.  Due to the
weakness of the rand, prices were quite reasonable, even in the worst of
tourist traps.  After lunch we went on a cruise around the Cape Town
harbor.  We saw some local penguins and some crazy birds that actually dive
into the water to catch fish.  Dinner and bars followed.

<h3>Day Ten (Images 611 - 625)</h3>

Today we went to the Cape of Good Hope where the Atlantic and Indian oceans
meet.  The view and scenery were spectacular.  We stopped in Simon's Town
for breakfast and a little shopping.  Troops of babboons live in the Cape
Point area which can be dangerous if teased with food.  We saw one such
troop on the side of the road on the way back from the point.  I did my
best not to look like food.  That afternoon we went to the beach - it was
overcast so it was nothing to write home about although the sand was fine
and white.  On a sunny day, it would be great.  We had daquaris at the
Ambassador Hotel on the beach and then went home at 7:30 PM for a quick nap
before dinner.  We woke up 4 hours later hungry and rushed out (minus
Andrew who was inclined to keep sleeping) hoping something would still be
open.  We went to a local establishment called News Cafe.  This place was
great.  Combine a bar, restaurant and coffee house all in one and make the
prices cheap.  I never wanted to leave.  There we talked the waitress into
keeping the kitchen open past midnight to cook us food.  The food was great
and ChrisP decided we needed to get a drink.  He had noticed a drink on the
cocktail menu called a "Flaming Lambourghini" and we collectively decided
this was a drink that was calling to us.
<p>
Five minutes later the waitress and two bartenders come to our table with
two trays full of shots and 4 big glasses.  Apparently this is a drink that
requires an owners manual.  The bartender explained to ChrisP that the
initial shot is lit on fire and you need to suck up the first shot while
the others are poured into the glass.  The final shot is cream which puts
out the fire.  In all, you suck up about 4 shots in 15 seconds.  We downed
our drinks in turn and chatted with the bartender/owner for a few minutes.
He gave us passes to a party at a great local club called the Rhodes House.
We exited posthaste - destination Rhodes House.  To make a annoying story
short, the Rhodes House would not let me in due to my wearing sneakers (or
tackies as they call them) despite our passes and pleas.  We instead went
to Club Dharma, which was very low key, and then to The Fez where dancing
girls, impromptu make out sessions and angry bouncers make for a story
inappropriate for the kids.  Suffice it to say the last night was the most
memorable in Cape Town.

<h3>Day Eleven (no images)</h3>

Spent the day packing, had brunch at a beautiful, local botanical garden
and went to the airport to begin our long journey back.  6 movies and 30
hours later, we arrived in Austin tired and glad to be home.
