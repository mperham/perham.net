			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My AV system is getting a bit long in the tooth.  I bought the system when I bought my house 7 years ago and no self-respecting technophile can be seen without a flat panel TV these days.  So I&#8217;m considering mounting an LCD TV to the wall, embedding speakers in the wall and moving the components into a closet to regain most of the floor space currently taken.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;d really like to do is make my system more Internet friendly.  I&#8217;ve got Ethernet right there and I want to be able to view material on the TV that I download, stream from Hulu or watch on a DVD or BluRay disc.  I&#8217;ve already got a NAS device, TiVo and laptop and the last thing I want is another computer running 24/7.  It&#8217;s too bad the manufacturers and content providers can&#8217;t do more to converge these devices so they work better together.  The reality is that none of these companies wants to give an inch to the others so something like MythTV running on a SFF computer might be my best choice to control my own entertainment destiny.  An Apple TV or hacked Mac mini might also be a possibility.  We shall see.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why the NSA is obsolete:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think the problem is more serious than people realize. I talked to the people at Fort Gordon [in Georgia], which is the main listening post for the Middle East and North Africa. What was shocking to me was the people who were there were saying they didn&#8217;t have anybody [at the time] who spoke Pashtun. We&#8217;re at war in Afghanistan and the main language of the Taliban is Pashtun.</p>
<p>The answer here is to change our foreign policy so that we don&#8217;t have to depend on agencies like NSA to try to protect the country. You try to protect the country by having reasonable policies so that we won&#8217;t have to worry about terrorism so much. It&#8217;s just getting harder and harder to find them.</p></blockquote>
