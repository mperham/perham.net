		<description>Hey - me too! I always install AppBar on any new system I set up. It's the easiest, most convenient, most unobtrusive and most memory-frugal launcher app I know of, and I must have tried them all over the past ten years. I kind of wish it had a sub-menu level, but otherwise it's perfect.</description>

		<description>I modded my brothers old xbox (1) a couple months back &#38; am running XBMC on it.  I'm pulling everything from my  NAS with a 1TB disk attached.  The NAS is just a NSLU2 which will run LOTS of servers &#38; apps (google it).     XBMC on the xbox is pretty cool, except it doesn't have the power needed to do 1080p.  The better solution I think is to build a small HTPC &#38; run XBMC for win/osx/linux.</description>

		<description>I'm a little more unhappy with the system these days.  I find the system really slow - it takes 10 seconds to boot up, takes 5 seconds to switch functions.

I find the alarm annoying because I still don't know how to cancel the alarm!  Every Saturday I get woken up.

In short, it's got a ton of functionality but does none of it very well.  I'd look for something else these days.</description>

		<description>Agree with your review; great little package.  But be warned.  The remote provides the only access to many system functions including high def. radio mode.  My remote failed and I can't find a replacement.  You could end up with a lot less functionality than you bargined for!</description>

		<description>After viewing a few mutting posts over the past month or two, I'm not a fan of the new look for mutterings.  You should separate work and pleasure, including the look.  Express a clean look in a different way.</description>

		<description>Yeah, I didn't think about the name until Apple had already approved it (and the name).  Apple gets 30%, I get 70%.</description>

		<description>Zinger is on the last of 91 pages in the iTune store.  Need to rename it to A-Zinger or iZinger, so it can be found right away.  Location, location, location.  (Marketing 101).  

What is the royality agreemant?

How about iBinoculars.  Think about it.</description>
