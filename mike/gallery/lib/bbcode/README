The BBCode library was written by Christian Seiler and can be found
here:

	http://www.christian-seiler.de/projekte/php/bbcode/

It is released under the artistic license.  It has been modified very
slighly to fit into Gallery, and all modifications to the original
source can be found by browsing the CVS repository here:

http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/gallery/trunk/gallery2/lib/bbcode/bbcode.class

The initial revision of this file in CVS is the original file from
Christian's website.

The class name was changed from BBCode to GalleryBbcode to avoid
issues with other applications that include their own BBCode class.
